# Traces — debug AI work from its span tree

Every agent run, chat turn and AI job (`chat.compact`, `document.index`, `document.convert`) is
recorded as OTLP spans (D32, `docs/CONCEPTS.md` §9). They **always** land in the tenant-scoped
`ai_spans` table, whether or not a backend is configured, so this works on a laptop with zero
credentials. An OTLP backend (Langfuse, Phoenix, …) receives the same spans on top. You read them
from the terminal; nothing here needs a vendor account.

**Read-only.** This skill diagnoses. It never edits code or config without the user saying yes to a
named change.

## 1. Find the trace

```
pnpm cli traces list [--agent <key>] [--status error] [--run <id>] [--conversation <id>] [--since <iso>] [--json]
pnpm cli traces show <traceId | runId | messageId> [--full] [--json]
```

- `$ARGUMENTS` is a run id (from the Agents page or `GET /api/agents/runs`) or a chat message id →
  `show` it directly; the server resolves either to its trace. A 32-hex id is already a trace id.
- "The latest failure" → `traces list --status error`, newest first; `--agent chat` for chat turns.
- `show … --json` is the whole span list (parse it with `jq` when the tree is large); `--full`
  prints tool and model content unclipped (default clip: 400 chars).
- **401** → `pnpm cli login`. **403 (exit 3)** → the key's role is below admin: `/api/traces` is
  `read Trace`, admin+ only, because spans hold other people's prompts. **404 `trace_not_found`** →
  nothing recorded yet (a run still `queued`), another tenant's id, or pruned — spans older than
  `OBSERVABILITY_SPAN_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 14) are deleted by the nightly `pruneAiSpans`.

## 2. Read the tree

```
invoke_agent research-topic   ERROR …            ← root: the run / turn / job, its input and output
  └ execute#0                                     ← one per Workflow step (runs only), retries included
    └ chat claude-sonnet-5  1200→340 tok  2.1s    ← one per model call: tokens in→out, finish reason
    └ execute_tool search_knowledge  0.4s         ← one per tool call: in: args · out: result
      └ retrieval search_chunks                   ← hybrid search: query in, hits (doc, seq, score) out
        └ embeddings @cf/baai/bge-m3              ← the query embedding
```

- Chat turns are `invoke_agent chat` with the generations and tools directly beneath (no step span).
  Jobs are `job <type>` roots (`job chat.compact`, `job document.index` → one `embeddings` per batch).
- **A run's root is recorded by the final `finish` step**, derived from the run id so each step's
  span already points at it. A tree of `execute#N` spans with no root above them is a run **still in
  flight** (or parked on a person) — not a bug. Several `execute#N` under one root are retries or
  resumes; the trace's status is the ROOT's, so a tool error inside a run that recovered is not a
  failed run.
- `content` absent everywhere (no `in:` / `out:` lines) means the deployment runs with
  `OBSERVABILITY_CAPTURE_CONTENT=false`: names, timings, tokens and statuses survive, prompts and tool
  I/O do not. Say so rather than guessing what was sent.

## 3. Triage, in this order

1. **The failing span.** The first `ERROR` in tree order is usually the cause; the root's message
   is the sentence the run stored. A provider error on a `chat <model>` span (rate limit,
   overloaded, bad credentials) is infrastructure — point at `resolveChat`'s tier (tenant config,
   platform key, Workers AI) rather than the agent.
2. **Tool arguments and results.** Read `in:` against the tool's schema (`services/agents/tools/`):
   a model passing strings for numbers, a wrong document id, an offset past the end. Read `out:`: a
   tool answering `{ error, hint }` is a dead end the model should act on — did the next generation
   act on it or call the same thing again?
3. **Empty or irrelevant retrieval.** `retrieval` output with zero hits, or hits from the wrong
   documents: the knowledge base is empty for this requester (D29 visibility applies), the documents
   are not `indexed`, or embeddings failed. Dense search always returns *something*, so check the
   titles, not just the count.
4. **Outliers.** Tokens-in growing turn over turn is the transcript growing (a tool result too big;
   `get_document` windows are the usual suspect). A slow `chat` span with few output tokens is the
   provider; a slow `execute_tool` is the database or an outbound call. Many turns ending in no
   terminal call is the loop cap (`AGENT_MAX_TURNS`) — the agent's salvage path should appear last.
5. **Report**: the span, what it shows (quote the args/result), the likely cause, and the file where
   the fix lives. Offer the change; do not make it unasked.

**Hand-off.** A failure worth keeping should become a regression case (D33). If a person rated it
down, `pnpm cli feedback list --rating down` finds it, and `pnpm cli evals promote <messageId|runId>
--dataset <name>` drafts the case, with the retrieved passages and tool calls included. It's tenant
data, so say so. Then hand over to `launch-evals` to write the expectation and run it. Traces from eval
runs are tagged `launch.eval=true`, and a thumbs vote shows in `traces show` as a `feedback`
span under the root.

## 4. Coaching: where traces go

Tell the user plainly which of these they are on (`pnpm preflight` prints a `· tracing` line) and
what switching costs. All keys are in `apps/web/.dev.vars` locally; deployed, the non-secret ones go
in `[vars]` of **both** tomls (parity test) and the secrets through `wrangler secret put` or
`pnpm provision secrets <env>`.

| Backend | Set | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Local only** (default) | nothing | `ai_spans` + `pnpm cli traces`. 14 days' retention (`OBSERVABILITY_SPAN_RETENTION_DAYS`) |
| **Langfuse Cloud** | secrets `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | the `langfuse` preset is picked automatically: OTLP to `https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel`, Basic auth + `x-langfuse-ingestion-version: 4`. A pre-D32 deployment migrates with no new secret. Optional `OBSERVABILITY_TRACE_URL=https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/<id>/traces/{traceId}` makes `traces show` print a link |
| **Self-hosted Langfuse** | the two keys + `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` (or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<host>/api/public/otel`) | same preset |
| **Phoenix** | `OBSERVABILITY_PRESET=phoenix`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:6006` | locally: `docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix`, UI on :6006. Protobuf by default — Phoenix accepts only `application/x-protobuf`. Phoenix Cloud: its URL as the endpoint, and the auth header its docs give in `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` |
| **Any OTLP/HTTP backend** | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (+ secret `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=k=v,k=v`, values URL-encoded) | JSON by default; `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` if it needs it. `/v1/traces` is appended |

- `OBSERVABILITY_CAPTURE_CONTENT=false` strips prompts, completions and tool I/O from the export
  **and** from `ai_spans` — the choice for tenants whose data must not leave the database or be kept.
- The backend is platform-wide; per-tenant backends are not built (`docs/CONCEPTS.md` §9 Known gaps).
- A backend that rejects spans never breaks a request: the export is swallowed and logged as
  `tracing: OTLP export returned a non-OK status` in the wrangler console — look there first when
  "nothing shows up", then check the endpoint and preset with `pnpm preflight`.
