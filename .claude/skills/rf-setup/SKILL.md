# First run

You are driving `scripts/bootstrap.sh` for someone who may never have run this kit. It does
SETUP.md Part 1 end to end and is **idempotent** — re-running after a fix is always safe.

## Constraints on you (Claude)

- You may reach this skill from a plain "help me set up this project" — the user need not
  have typed `/rf-setup`. Before the first command, say in one sentence what the script will do
  to their machine (start a Postgres container, write `apps/web/.dev.vars`, seed a demo
  database) and that it is idempotent. Then run it; don't wait for permission you already have.
- Your Bash tool has **no TTY** and a **2-minute default timeout**. Always run the bootstrap with a
  10-minute timeout (`timeout: 600000`) — `pnpm install` alone can take minutes on a cold machine.
- Never start or stop the user's dev stack with raw `kill`/`docker` commands; the script and
  `pnpm dev:stop` / `pnpm dev:status` own that.
- Show the user the script's output as you go. Every step prints a `✔` line; the last line is the
  verification line. Do not summarise a failure away — quote it.
- The `plugins` step (6) installs code from other repositories into this one. **Name them before
  you run the bootstrap**, the same way you name the Postgres container — the kit's own
  `defaultPlugins` is `analytics` (dashboards, cubes, the drizzle-cube API), and an app's copy may
  list more. `--no-plugins` skips the step and gives a working app without them; `/rf-plugin` is the
  skill for installing one afterwards, where the plan is read before anything is written.

## 0. Is this a copy, or the kit itself?

The kit is a template, not an upstream (`docs/ADAPTING.md` §0). A copy that still carries the kit's
history will fight a repository that keeps evolving, so the first run is the moment to detach — but
detaching is **destructive and cannot be undone**, so never do it unasked.

```
git log --oneline | head -3 && git log --oneline | wc -l && git remote -v
```

Offer the detach ONLY when all of these hold, and say which one you saw:

- there is more than one commit, and the first commit is **not** `Start from Launch`
  (`git log --reverse --oneline | head -1`) — the one-liner installer already detaches, so a copy
  made that way needs nothing;
- `origin` points at the kit's own repository.

Then **ask before running it** (`AskUserQuestion`), and say plainly what is lost: every commit,
irreversibly, replaced by one of their own. Two cases you must name in the question, because the
signature is identical for both:

- **They copied the kit** → detaching is right, and is what `docs/ADAPTING.md` §0 tells them to do.
- **This IS the kit** (they are working on Launch itself, or a fork they intend to pull from)
  → say no. Deleting the history of the kit's own checkout is the one truly unrecoverable thing in
  this skill.

On yes, record the commit first so the copy remembers where it came from — that id is the only way
to diff against the kit later:

```
KIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
rm -rf .git && git init -q && git add -A
git commit -q -m "Start from Launch" -m "Kit commit: $KIT_COMMIT"
```

Then tell them to add their own `origin`. On no, or on any doubt, carry on to step 1 unchanged —
setup works either way, and they can detach later by hand.

## 1. Run it

```
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --no-dev $ARGUMENTS
```

`--no-dev` means the script does NOT start the servers (you will, in step 3). `--offline` skips
the Cloudflare login / Workers AI probe; `--no-demo` runs plain `pnpm seed` (tenant, users and key,
but no populated workspace); `--no-plugins` skips the `plugins` step, which installs the plugins
`.rocketflare.json` lists in `defaultPlugins` (step 6 below) — use it when the machine is offline or
when somebody wants the app bare first. `--db-url <postgres-url>` uses a database that already
exists (a Neon branch in a sandbox with no Docker) instead of starting one. Docker is then not
checked, the URL goes into `apps/web/.dev.vars`, step 4 only waits for it to answer, and the seed
is allowed to write to it. Use it when `docker` is missing and the user has given you a URL; never
invent one, and never echo the URL back (it holds a password). A Neon URL (`*.neon.tech`) also
selects the `neon` driver locally — HTTPS and WebSocket only, which a sandbox with no TCP out
allows; any other URL gets `postgres`.

`--driver neon|postgres` sets the LOCAL database driver (D35), written to `apps/web/.dev.vars` as
`DATABASE_DRIVER`. The default is `postgres` (TCP to the Docker database, nothing else running),
whatever the tomls say — their `DATABASE_DRIVER` is the DEPLOYED driver, `neon` in a fresh copy.
Don't pass `--driver` unless the user asks to run the deployed Neon driver locally: `neon` with the
Docker database also starts a Neon proxy container in step 4 (a community image, pinned). A re-run
keeps whatever `.dev.vars` already says. Switch later with `pnpm dev:db:up --neon` / `--postgres`.

## 2. Read the exit code

| Exit | Meaning | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | every step passed | go to step 3 |
| 1 | a step failed | show the tail of the output, fix the cause, re-run the same command (idempotent). A failing `6/10 plugins` is the one worth reading closely: re-run with `--no-plugins` to get a working app, then install the plugin with `/rf-plugin`, where the plan is shown before anything is written |
| 2 | usage error | check `$ARGUMENTS` against the hint above and re-run |
| 3 | a prerequisite is missing | install it, then re-run: Node 24 via `nvm install` (reads `.nvmrc`) or `fnm use`; pnpm via `corepack enable`; Docker via Docker Desktop, or `brew install colima docker && colima start` on macOS, or Docker Engine + the `docker` group on Linux. If Docker can't run here (a sandbox), ask the user for a Postgres URL (a Neon branch) and re-run with `--db-url` |
| 4 | a dev port is held by another checkout | the DATABASE port is chosen automatically (`scripts/dev-db.mjs` takes the next free one), so this is :3000/:3001 (or `DEV_UI_PORT`/`DEV_API_PORT`): run `pnpm dev:status` and `pnpm dev:db:status`, show the user the other path/pid, and let THEM decide — stop it there, or move this checkout with `DEV_UI_PORT`/`DEV_API_PORT` in `apps/web/.dev.vars` plus `APP_URL` on the new UI port (SETUP.md 1.6) — never kill another checkout's processes |
| 5 | Cloudflare login required | see below |

**Exit 5 — Cloudflare login.** Explain in one sentence: *the kit's zero-key chat and agents run on
Workers AI, which `wrangler dev` proxies through a logged-in Cloudflare account (a free one is
enough), and every call is billed to that account (10 000 free neurons a day).* Then ask: log in,
or stay offline?

- Log in: tell the user to run `pnpm web exec wrangler login` **in their own terminal** (the
  browser OAuth callback must outlive a tool call, so you cannot run it), wait for them to confirm,
  then re-run the bootstrap with `--online`.
- Stay offline: re-run with `--offline`. Chat/agents answer 503 until a key or tenant provider
  exists (SETUP.md 2.5); everything else works.

## 3. After success — start the app and sign in

1. Start the dev stack in the background (`run_in_background: true`):
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```
2. Poll until the API answers, at most 90 seconds (if `apps/web/.dev.vars` sets `DEV_API_PORT` /
   `DEV_UI_PORT`, use those ports instead of 3001 / 3000 here and in step 3):
   ```
   curl -s localhost:3001/api/health
   ```
   You should see `{"status":"ok",…}`. If nothing after 90 s, run `pnpm dev:status` and show it.
3. Open the dev sign-in for the demo owner (macOS `open`, Linux `xdg-open`):
   ```
   open "http://localhost:3000/login?as=owner@example.test"
   ```
4. Report what is true now, in **at most six lines** — where the app is (the two URLs), who they
   are signed in as (**owner@example.test**; also `admin@` and `member@example.test`, and the
   global admin `admin@clewro.com`), the port Postgres landed on if it was not 5432, the
   local database driver if it is not `postgres` (`neon`, through the proxy — step 4 says so), **any
   plugin the `plugins` step installed and the page it adds** (`pnpm plugin list` names them; say
   "no plugins installed" rather than nothing when there are none), and any note the script printed
   (an orphaned volume, `--offline`). Do not restate the ten ✔ lines
   they just watched, and **do not echo the seeded API key** — it was printed once by the seed and
   is in their scrollback; say that `pnpm cli login` mints another whenever they want one.

## 4. Then ask what they want to do next — do not guess

A first run ends with the person looking at a working app and no idea what the next move is, so
**end the turn with `AskUserQuestion`**, not with a paragraph of suggestions and not with an
open "want me to do anything else?". Offer these, in this order, with the first as the default:

| Option | What you do when it is chosen |
|---|---|
| **Show me around** | Walk the seeded app: **Chat** (streams a reply — Workers AI needs the `wrangler login`, else a key), **Agents** (`summarize-text`, watch the timeline fill), **Knowledge → Search** (the demo documents are indexed), **Analytics** (the seeded Organisation Overview). Drive it with them; one screen at a time |
| **Check it really works** | `pnpm test:db:up && pnpm test` (ephemeral Postgres on :5433) — which runs the analytics plugin's own tests too, including the two-tenant cube isolation one — then the SETUP.md 1.6 analytics check, `pnpm cli analytics check-facts` |
| **Make it mine** | `/rf-adapt <slug>` — the rename (package scope, Worker, database, CLI, theme). Ask for the slug if they have not said one |
| **Add a capability** | `/rf-plugin` — install a plugin (a git repository copied in, with a plan you read first), or audit what is installed with `pnpm plugin list` / `pnpm plugin check` |
| **Deploy it** | `/rf-provision` — **user-invoked only**: tell them to type it, and that it needs the three accounts (Cloudflare on Workers Paid, Neon, Resend) and `pnpm provision tokens` in their own terminal first |

Leave the dev stack running unless they ask you to stop it (`pnpm dev:stop`). If they pick
something not on the list, just do that — the list is a starting point, not a gate.

## What each ✔ line means

Lines read `✔ n/10 <name> <what it verified>` (a failure is `✖ n/10 <name> <message>` plus a
`fix:` hint). `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh` first prints its own `✔ os / git / docker / node / pnpm`
prerequisite lines, then hands over to `scripts/bootstrap.mjs` for the ten steps:

| Step | Name | What it proved |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `toolchain` | Node 24, pnpm 10, Docker daemon and `docker compose` reachable. With `--db-url` it reads `docker skipped (external database <host>/<db>)` |
| 2 | `install` | `pnpm install` done; `wrangler` resolves in `apps/web` |
| 3 | `secrets` | `apps/web/.dev.vars` exists with `DATABASE_URL`, `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (generated, git-ignored) and `DATABASE_DRIVER` (the LOCAL driver, D35: `postgres` unless `--driver`, a Neon `--db-url`, or a value already there says otherwise — a note names it when it changes). With `--db-url` it notes `DATABASE_URL set from --db-url` |
| 4 | `database` | this checkout's Postgres container is up and healthy on the port it chose (5432 unless taken; the step says so and writes it to `.dev.vars`); the `Connected to … (<driver> driver)` part names the local driver. Under `neon` the Neon proxy container is up too (`local driver neon: Neon proxy at http://localhost:<port>`). With `--db-url` there is no container: the line reads `external <host>/<db> · Connected to …` once `db:check` answers |
| 5 | `migrate` | role → migrations → grants applied; the pgvector extension is installed |
| 6 | `plugins` | every plugin in `.rocketflare.json`'s `defaultPlugins` is installed, its tables generated and migrated. The kit declares ONE — `analytics`, which is where dashboards, cubes and the fact table live from 0.6.0 (`docs/CONCEPTS.md` §8) — so this step is what makes **Analytics** appear in the nav. Skipped with `--no-plugins`, which is a perfectly good app with no analytics in it and no drizzle-cube in either bundle |
| 7 | `seed` | demo tenant, owner/admin/member users, one API key (printed once), plus the populated demo workspace unless `--no-demo`. The seed prints `seeding <host>/<db>` first; with `--db-url` it runs with `SEED_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` |
| 8 | `cloudflare` | wrangler is logged in (Workers AI available) — or `--offline` was chosen |
| 9 | `cli` | `pnpm cli whoami` with the seeded key — deferred/skipped with `--no-dev` (needs the server) |
| 10 | `run` | `pnpm dev` started and `/api/health` answered — skipped with `--no-dev` (you do it in step 3) |

**Why `plugins` sits before `seed`:** a plugin may contribute a demo-data hook, so installing one
after the seed would leave the demo workspace missing exactly the rows the plugin exists to show.
The step runs `pnpm plugin add <repo> --apply` per plugin, then one `pnpm db:generate --name
plugin-<id>` each and a single `pnpm db:migrate` — it does not print those and leave them to you,
because the bootstrap promises a working app and a barrel line with no table does not typecheck.
An id already installed is skipped, so a re-run is safe.

With `--no-dev` the script stops after step 8 and prints the three things to run next (`pnpm
dev`, the login URL, `pnpm cli login`). If a line reads `✖`, the exit code table above says what
to do. The script's own output is authoritative; when it and this table disagree, trust the script.
