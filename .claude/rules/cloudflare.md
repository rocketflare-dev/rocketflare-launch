# Cloudflare Workers

One Worker, one deploy target. The Hono app, the `NotificationsHub` Durable Object, the
`AgentRunWorkflow` and the queue/cron handlers all ship in `apps/web/src/worker.ts`. Reference: docs/DEPLOY.md. Everything here lives in `apps/web/`; wrangler is a devDependency of
that package, so run it as `pnpm --filter @launch/web exec wrangler …` (never `pnpm exec wrangler` at the
workspace root) or through the root scripts (`pnpm deploy[:staging]`, `pnpm provision`, `pnpm types`).

## Bindings

- Typed by `pnpm types` → `apps/web/worker-configuration.d.ts` (`Cloudflare.Env`), committed. After editing a
  toml, run `pnpm types` and commit the result
- Baseline: `ASSETS`, `RATE_LIMIT_KV`, and `HYPERDRIVE` **only under `DATABASE_DRIVER = "postgres"`**
  (D35): the kit's tomls say `neon` and carry no `[[hyperdrive]]` block, so `wrangler types` omits
  it and `AppBindings` (`api/types.ts`) adds it back as optional — `Cloudflare.Env & { HYPERDRIVE?:
  Hyperdrive }`. The parity test wants the block in both tomls or neither, and none in a `neon` file.
  Phase 2: `JOBS_QUEUE`, `NOTIFICATIONS_HUB`,
  `FILES`. Phase 3 (built): `AGENT_RUN_WORKFLOW` (`[[workflows]]`, class `AgentRunWorkflow`) and `AI`
  (`[ai] binding = "AI"`, Workers AI embeddings). Launch P2: `APP_LAUNCH_WORKFLOW`,
  `APP_TEARDOWN_WORKFLOW`. Launch P3: `SESSION_SANDBOX` (the `SessionSandbox` container + Durable
  Object, below) and `SESSION_WORKFLOW` (`launch-session[-staging]`, class `SessionWorkflow`); a
  missing `SESSION_WORKFLOW` is a 503 `sessions_not_configured` before any row is written.
  Launch P5: `GRANT_PUSH_WORKFLOW` (`launch-grant-push[-staging]`, class `GrantPushWorkflow`); a
  missing one is a 503 `grants_not_configured` before any row, and `[vars] GRANT_BACKEND =
  "cloudflare"` (`local` is development only). The analytics PLUGIN (D19, D31) adds **no binding**:
  its cubes read through the request's database handle, its fact tables rebuild on a cron, and the optional `ANALYTICS_ENGINE`
  dataset is deliberately NOT wired (the toml comment is the only trace). Optional: `ANALYTICS_ENGINE`,
  `HYPERDRIVE_APP`
- Optional bindings are optional in code too: the rate limiter no-ops without `RATE_LIMIT_KV`,
  OTLP export without a configured backend (the local `ai_spans` store still records, D32), email without `RESEND_API_KEY`, realtime nudges without
  `NOTIFICATIONS_HUB`. Check presence, don't crash — **except where silence would lose data**: a
  missing `JOBS_QUEUE` throws `JobsQueueNotConfiguredError` (no inline fallback) and a missing
  `FILES` is a 503 `storage_not_configured`, a missing `AGENT_RUN_WORKFLOW` is a 503
  `agent_runs_not_configured` (before any row is written), and a missing `AI` binding is merely the next
  step in both AI chains (`services/ai/resolve.ts`: chat → 503 `ai_not_configured` unless a key or tenant
  row exists; embeddings → `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` → 503). With the binding present, Workers AI is the
  zero-key floor for BOTH — and every call bills the account, so removing `[ai]` from both tomls is the
  deliberate zero-spend switch. The same binding also converts knowledge uploads
  (`env.AI.toMarkdown`, `services/ai/convert.ts`): without it a PDF/Office/HTML upload is a 503
  `conversion_not_configured` at the route (nothing stored), text-type uploads keep working; document
  conversion is free on Workers AI (image conversion bills, which is why images are not accepted)
  Decide which of the three a new binding is and say so in its service header
- `[vars]` = non-secret config, visible in the toml. Secrets = `.dev.vars` locally,
  `wrangler secret put` deployed. Never a secret in a toml. AI vars in both tomls:
  `AGENT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS = "16384"`, `AGENT_MAX_TURNS = "30"`, `CHAT_KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS = "true"`, `CHAT_HISTORY_MAX_CHARS = "24000"`,
  `AGENT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT = "168 hours"` (passed verbatim to `step.waitForEvent`),
  `FEATURES_ENABLED = ""` (D30: keys this deployment ships at all; blank is fail-closed, and the key
  must ALSO be in `.dev.vars.example` — `wrangler dev` reads `[vars]` from `wrangler.toml`, so a
  feature shipped dark in production would otherwise be dark on every laptop),
  `OBSERVABILITY_CAPTURE_CONTENT = "true"`, `OBSERVABILITY_SPAN_RETENTION_DAYS = "14"` (D32);
  `OBSERVABILITY_PRESET`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`,
  `OBSERVABILITY_TRACE_URL`, `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` and `LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENVIRONMENT` default in
  `config.ts` and are added to BOTH files only when used (the parity test compares `[vars]` keys;
  the tomls carry them as a comment). AI secrets: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY`,
  `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` (`k=v,k=v`) — all optional

## Two tomls, one shape (D6)

`apps/web/wrangler.toml` (production) and `apps/web/wrangler.staging.toml` are standalone copies. `[env.*]` does not
inherit bindings, so two files are more honest than one with a hidden gap. They may differ in:
`name`, `routes`, `workers_dev`, `[vars]` values, resource `id`s, and account-scoped names. They
must NOT differ in: binding names, `class_name`s, `compatibility_date`/`flags`, `[limits]`,
`[triggers].crons`, `[assets]`, `[[migrations]]`.

**`[assets] run_worker_first = true` is not optional.** Cloudflare's asset router runs BEFORE the
Worker, and `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"` answers anything it treats as a
NAVIGATION with `index.html` without ever invoking `fetch`. `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate` is not just
the address bar — an `<object>`/`<iframe>` embed and an `<a download>` click are navigations too.
Launch P3 made it `true` rather than a prefix list: a coding session's PREVIEW is a navigation to
`/` on `<port>-<shortId>-<token>.<preview domain>`, which no prefix can name, and the asset router
would answer it with Launch's own `index.html`. So every request reaches the Worker: `src/worker.ts`
sends preview hosts to `api/preview/gateway.ts` before the Hono app, and the app's catch-all serves
`ASSETS` for the rest while JSON-404ing every prefix in `API_PREFIXES`
(`api/utils/routes/api-prefixes.ts` — add a top-level server prefix there). No test of the Hono app
can see the asset router, so `wrangler-parity.test.ts` asserts `true` in both tomls and that every
prefix is still `isApiPath`; `REQUIRE_PROVISIONED=1` additionally forbids `<PLACEHOLDER>` values
(CI sets it before deploy). `pnpm provision cloudflare` leaves `true` alone when a plugin declares
`apiPrefixes`.

**Containers (Launch P3).** `[[containers]]` (class `SessionSandbox`, `image =
"./containers/session/Dockerfile"`, `standard-3`, `max_instances = 10`) is identical in both files
and parity-checked like a binding. The class is a Durable Object too — `SESSION_SANDBOX` plus
`[[migrations]] tag = "v2", new_sqlite_classes` (the Sandbox SDK needs SQLite storage) — and
`src/worker.ts` also exports the SDK's `ContainerProxy`, which the platform routes the container's
outbound traffic through so `outboundByHost` runs in this Worker. `wrangler deploy` builds and pushes
the image (Docker); `pnpm build:api`'s dry run does not build it but refuses a missing Dockerfile.
**A change to the image or the block replaces running containers — drain sessions first**
(`docs/DEPLOY.md` § Coding sessions). `@cloudflare/sandbox` (0.12.10, stable) and the image's
`cloudflare/sandbox:<version>` base must stay on the SAME version, and the SDK is imported in two
files only (the DO class and `services/sessions/sandbox/cloudflare-sandbox.ts`); tests alias it to
`tests/mocks/cloudflare-sandbox.ts`.

## Account-scoped names

Workflow `name`, queue `queue`, R2 `bucket_name` and Analytics Engine `dataset` are unique per
Cloudflare account, not per Worker. **Whichever script last deployed a Workflow name owns it**, and
every instance created under that name — including by the other environment's binding — runs with
the owner's bindings, against the owner's database. Staging therefore suffixes all of them with
`-staging`; `binding` and `class_name` stay identical so no application code is environment-aware.
`pnpm --filter @launch/web exec wrangler workflows list` shows Name → Script name if you suspect a hijack.
The kit's Workflow is `launch-agent-run` (production) / `launch-agent-run-staging`;
`binding = "AGENT_RUN_WORKFLOW"` and `class_name = "AgentRunWorkflow"` are identical in both files.
Nothing is created by hand — `wrangler deploy` registers the Workflow, `[ai]` needs no resource.

The one place a name leaks into code is the queue consumer: `batch.queue` is the NAME
(`launch-jobs` / `launch-jobs-staging`), so `apps/web/src/api/queue.ts` matches it by
**prefix** — `isJobsQueue()` / `JOBS_QUEUE_NAME_PREFIX` in `apps/web/src/api/services/jobs.ts` —
and `ackAll()`s any queue it does not know. Renaming the queue = both tomls (`[[queues.producers]]`
+ `[[queues.consumers]]`) + that one constant (`tests/api/queue-dispatch.test.ts` pins both names).
Prefix matching also means a `launch-jobs-dlq` would be dispatched to the SAME consumer if you
ever bound a consumer to it — a dead-letter queue you want to inspect rather than reprocess needs a
name outside the prefix or its own branch in `queue.ts`.

## `[limits] cpu_ms` is per step

Workflows bound CPU **per `step.do`** by the script's `cpu_ms` (30 s default, 300 s max on Paid).
CPU is not wall clock: a step that is 95 % I/O still dies if it *processes* enough items. Declare
`[limits]` in BOTH files or in neither (parity test). Split a heavy phase into its own step to draw a
fresh budget. Isolate memory is 128 MiB and not configurable — page through large tables, never
preload them into a `Map`. In the kit the whole tool loop of an agent runs inside the ONE `execute`
step (`step.do('execute', { retries: { limit: 2, delay: '10 seconds', backoff: 'exponential' },
timeout: '10 minutes' }, …)`): model calls are I/O, so CPU is rarely the limit, but an agent that
chunks or parses a lot of text in-step draws against the same 30 s — raise `cpu_ms` (300 s max) before
reaching for structure. **Wall clock per step is unlimited**, so that `timeout: '10 minutes'` is the
kit's own policy and a long run is fixed by raising it, not by splitting. One `step.do` per model
turn was investigated and rejected (`docs/CONCEPTS.md` §9 Known gaps): steps do not nest, so it needs
`run()` outside a step, and everything outside a step is replayed.

## Handler shapes

- `queue(batch, env, ctx)` (`apps/web/src/api/queue.ts`): `loadConfig(env)` like `fetch`, prefix-match
  `batch.queue` → `processJobsBatch(batch, { env, config, logger })` (`api/queues/jobs.ts`); per
  message: invalid envelope → `ack()` (poison), handler ok → `ack()`, handler threw → `retry({
  delaySeconds })` (30 s doubling, 15 min cap; toml `max_retries = 3`, `retry_delay = 60` only for a
  retry without an explicit delay); own DB client per message, closed in `finally`; **no `waitUntil`
  in a consumer**. Plain function so tests call it (`.claude/rules/testing.md`)
- `scheduled(event, env, ctx)`: `SCHEDULED_TASKS` keyed on `event.cron` (`'0 4 * * *'` →
  `pruneExpired` + `pruneAiSpans` (D32 — `ai_spans` past `OBSERVABILITY_SPAN_RETENTION_DAYS`, one
  DELETE per tenant on the `(tenant_id, started_at)` index); plus every installed plugin's `scheduledTasks` (the analytics plugin's
  `'15 * * * *'` — every registered fact table, per tenant,
  DELETE+INSERT, per-tenant failures collected and logged as a warning); one DB client per run, closed
  in `waitUntil`; each task try/caught; a new cron string must be added to BOTH tomls and the table
  (the parity test compares `[triggers].crons`). `wrangler dev` never fires crons on its own — trigger
  them by hand (below). **A plugin declares the EXPRESSION in its `plugin.json` and the TASK through
  `ServerPlugin.scheduledTasks`; the two tomls are the host's.** A task keyed on an expression no
  toml carries simply never runs, and nothing anywhere says so — which is why installing a plugin
  with `crons[]` prints a numbered step, and `pnpm provision cloudflare <env>` writes it
- `AgentRunWorkflow` (`apps/web/src/api/workflows/agent-run.ts`): `run(event, step)` → `step.do('claim')` →
  `step.do('execute#N', { retries, timeout })` → `step.do('finish')`, with a round loop in between
  (below); each step wraps its body in
  `withStepDatabase(env, cfg, db => …)` — ONE DB client per step, `close()` awaited in `finally`
  (Hyperdrive or Neon is the pool). Bodies are plain functions in `services/agents/runtime.ts`; step return
  values are small serialisable objects (`{ runId, status }`), never rows. Steps are idempotent because
  the `agent_runs` row is the claim (`UPDATE … WHERE status IN (queued,running) RETURNING`; a retry
  re-claims). Cancellation is cooperative, escalating to `instance.terminate()` on a second request.
  No `waitUntil` in a step — nudges are collected and awaited by `createStepRealtime().settle()`, the
  tracer (`tracerFor(cfg, { store: databaseSpanStore(db) })`) is flushed at the end of `executeRun`
  while the step's client is still open, and the `finish` step records the run's root span (D32)
- **Parking on a human is `step.waitForEvent` + `instance.sendEvent`** (issue #17), which is
  Cloudflare's documented pattern for it — "wait for human approval" is a named use case. Five rules,
  every one of which has a failure mode nothing else catches:
  - **An event TYPE may contain only `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`.** A `.` is rejected with
    `workflow.invalid_event_type`, and no fake validates the name — so `AGENT_RESUME_EVENT` would
    first fail on a real approval, in production. `tests/config/agent-interrupts.test.ts` pins the
    regex; keep that test.
  - **Every step name in the loop carries its round** (`execute#0`, `resume#0`, `expire#0`,
    `execute#1`…). The platform treats a step name as that step's identity and replays a repeated
    one's recorded result — reuse `execute` and the second attempt silently returns the first one's
    answer, which reads exactly like "the agent ignored my approval". `MAX_INTERRUPT_ROUNDS` bounds
    the loop; step count never will (10 000 per instance on Paid).
  - **A `waiting` instance is not executing**: it is excluded from the concurrent-instance cap, so
    millions can park at once, and a park costs no invocation, no connection and no query. The
    timeout is 1 second to 365 days (`AGENT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT` in `[vars]`, both tomls).
  - **Instance retention — 30 days Paid, 3 days Free — is the real bound on a park, not the
    timeout.** Past it the instance is gone, `waitForEvent` never fires, and only the read-path
    `expireParkedRun` and the `sendEvent → not_found` restart (a new instance `<runId>-r1`) recover
    it. Those two are load-bearing, not defensive.
  - **`wrangler dev` loses every instance on restart**, which is the same case, so the restart path
    is exercised locally by stopping and starting the dev server with a run parked (`SETUP.md` §2.5).
- `NotificationsHub` DO (`apps/web/src/api/durable-objects/notifications-hub.ts`): one per tenant
  (`idFromName(tenantId)`), **stateless** (no `ctx.storage` → `[[migrations]]` stays `new_classes`
  only), hibernation API (`acceptWebSocket` with tags `tenant:<id>`/`user:<id>`, attachment `{
  userId, sessionId, connectedAt }`), `setWebSocketAutoResponse(ping → pong)` instead of any
  `setInterval`. Publish via RPC — `broadcast(event)`, `broadcastToUser(userId, event)`,
  `broadcastToUsers(userIds, event)` → `{ delivered }`, `connectionCount()` → `{ count }` — never
  `fetch` dispatch; `fetch()` accepts ONLY the upgrade forwarded by `routes/ws.ts` (trusted `X-*`
  identity headers, safe because the object is reachable solely via the binding). The class is
  exported from `src/worker.ts`, never from `api/index.ts`
- **A long-lived SSE read (`GET …/agui/stream`, issue #7) budgets three things, and all three are
  per-INVOCATION.** ONE database client for the life of the stream (`streamDatabase(c)`, closed in
  `finally`), never one per tick — even for a route that writes nothing. **Subrequests are capped at
  1 000 per invocation on Paid**, which is why `RUN_STREAM_MAX_MS` is 10 minutes: the adaptive
  cadence puts the tick count (~320) provably under it, and it makes a redeploy indistinguishable
  from the normal path, so the client's reconnect is exercised on every stream rather than only
  during an incident. **Nothing that costs a subrequest may sit inside the loop** — a Workflow
  `instance.status()` per tick would blow the budget on a question the database already answers. And
  a run parked on `step.waitForEvent` must NOT hold the connection: the stream sends its terminal
  frame and closes, so a seven-day park costs no connection, no query and no invocation
- Never run long work in `fetch`. Enqueue or create a workflow instance (`.claude/rules/api.md`)

## Bundle size (the analytics plugin's caveat)

`pnpm build:api` (`wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir dist/api`) is where the Worker's size shows;
`gzip -c dist/api/worker.js | wc -c` is the number. **No figure is written down here or in any other
doc, deliberately** — it moves with every dependency bump, so a quoted one is wrong almost
immediately and reads as a budget nobody is holding. Measure it when you need it.

With the analytics plugin installed, drizzle-cube dominates the bundle, and it is one import:
`drizzle-cube/adapters/hono` statically
imports `dist/adapters/mcp-transport-*.js` (the MCP SDK plus inlined chart rendering) even when
`mcp.enabled` is false. It is not the kit pulling React or recharts into the Worker — the sourcemap
has no `node_modules/react|recharts` entries reached from `src/api`. It is under the Workers script
cap (3 MiB gzip on the free plan, higher on Paid), so it is accepted for now. Do not "fix" it by
adding chunking or externals to the Worker build; the real fix is upstream (a lazy `import()` of the
MCP path in the adapter) or a thin adapter of our own over `drizzle-cube/server`. When you add a
dependency to `src/api`, compare `gzip -c dist/api/worker.js | wc -c` before and after — **the delta
is the thing to look at, not the absolute.**

## Plugins and the tomls (D31)

**A plugin never edits a wrangler toml; `pnpm provision cloudflare <env>` does it for you, from the
plugin's own `plugin.json`.** Four declarations, and the phase writes the first four rows into BOTH
tomls before it creates anything — the ordinary parity test compares binding names, `[vars]` keys,
crons and `run_worker_first` across the two files on every `pnpm test`, so patching only one would
leave the gate red until somebody remembered the other.

| Declared | What provisioning does | Still an agent step |
|---|---|---|
| `bindings[]` — `{ type: "kv"\|"queue"\|"r2", binding, name, consumer? }` | creates `<app>-<id>-<name>[-staging]` (`<APP>_<ID>_<NAME>[_STAGING]` for KV) and inserts the block in BOTH tomls, identical `binding`, per-env account-scoped name, KV id as a `<PLACEHOLDER>` until that env is provisioned | `pnpm types` and committing `worker-configuration.d.ts`; a type outside the supported five (`d1`, `vectorize`, `analytics_engine`…) is a **loud refusal naming the type** — create it and add the block to both files yourself |
| `bindings[]` — `{ type: "workflow", binding, name, className }` | inserts `[[workflows]]` in BOTH tomls with the same `binding` and `class_name` and the account-scoped `name = "<app>-<id>-<name>[-staging]"`. **Nothing is created**: `wrangler deploy` registers it | `pnpm types` |
| `bindings[]` — `{ type: "durable_object", binding, className, storage }` | inserts `[[durable_objects.bindings]]` in BOTH tomls (`name = "<BINDING>"`, `class_name`) **plus one `[[migrations]]` entry tagged `plugin-<id>-v1`**, `new_sqlite_classes` or `new_classes` per `storage` | `pnpm types`; on REMOVAL, the `deleted_classes` migration is a **human** step — it destroys the namespace and everything in it |
| `crons[]` | appends to `[triggers] crons` in BOTH tomls, idempotently | the task itself arrives through `ServerPlugin.scheduledTasks`, keyed on the same expression |
| `apiPrefixes[]` | appends `p` and `p/*` to `[assets] run_worker_first` in BOTH tomls | the Vite dev proxy. The prefix is also unioned into `API_PREFIXES` from the server barrel, and `wrangler-parity.test.ts` asserts both tomls MIRROR that list — so a drift between the MANIFEST and the barrel fails the gate rather than silently serving the app shell for an `<object>` embed or an `<a download>` |
| `vars[]` — `{ key, example?, secret? }` | a non-secret key is appended to `[vars]` in BOTH tomls with its `example` as the value (an existing key is never rewritten — its value is the operator's); a `"secret": true` one is offered by `pnpm provision secrets <env>` from an exported variable or `.provision.env` | the `.dev.vars.example` line for a secret, and the local value. The key itself is validated by `SharedPlugin.config`, merged into the Worker's config schema |

The account-scoping rule is unchanged and applies to a plugin's resources exactly as to the kit's: a
queue, R2 bucket, Workflow name or Analytics Engine dataset is unique per Cloudflare ACCOUNT, so
staging's must differ. **A plugin's Workflow is the sharpest case of that** — the incident in
`docs/DEPLOY.md` is one script owning a shared Workflow name and running the other environment's
instances against the other environment's database, with nothing erroring — so its `name` carries
`-staging` exactly as `<app>-agent-run-staging` does. A Durable Object binding has no
account-scoped name at all and is byte-identical in both files. `binding` and `class_name` stay
identical everywhere, because no application code — a plugin's included — is environment-aware. The
naming rule lives in ONE place, `scripts/provision/plugin-resources.ts`, and it is a wire format:
rename a resource and the next provision run creates a second one beside the live one and points
the toml at it.

**A class binding is only writable because of the sixth barrel** (D31). `class_name` resolves
against the named exports of `src/worker.ts` and nowhere else, so before
`apps/web/src/plugins/worker-exports.ts` existed, writing either block would have produced a toml
pointing at a class nothing exported — and `wrangler deploy` refuses the whole script for that.
`d1`, `vectorize` and `analytics_engine` have no equivalent mechanism and stay refused BY NAME.
`hyperdrive` is refused for a different reason — the host owns the one database (and may not use
Hyperdrive at all, D35), and asking for a second is a design conversation rather than a flag.

**A `[[migrations]]` tag is append-only and host-owned**, which is the same rule the SQL migrations
follow and for the same reason: it is the record of what this Worker has already told Cloudflare.
An install writes `plugin-<id>-v1`; a removal takes the next free `plugin-<id>-v<n>` with
`deleted_classes`. A tag is never renumbered and never rewritten — replaying one under a different
meaning loses a namespace and everything stored in it.

## `nodejs_compat`: what is allowed

Allowed and used: `Buffer`, `AsyncLocalStorage`, `node:crypto` hashing, `process.env` **inside
dependencies only**. Banned in `apps/web/src/`: `pg`, `pg-boss`, `ws`, `node:fs`, `node:child_process`,
`node:http`, `@hono/node-server`, `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`, any `setInterval` at module scope,
`process.env` (read config via `loadConfig(env)`). `pnpm build:api` (dry-run `wrangler deploy`) is
the check `tsc` cannot do — run it before pushing a new dependency.

## Local testing of the non-HTTP entry points

`wrangler dev` (`pnpm dev:api`, :3001) emulates KV, Queues, DO, R2 and Workflows locally and reads
the database from `.dev.vars` (`DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres` + `DATABASE_URL`, or `neon` +
`NEON_LOCAL_PROXY` after `pnpm dev:db:up --neon`; a copy with a `[[hyperdrive]]` block also gets its
`localConnectionString`). **Start and stop the stack through the scripts, never by
killing a pid**: `pnpm dev` runs `scripts/dev-server.mjs --preflight` first (clears this repo's
leftovers, then refuses to start — exit 1, naming the pid — if anything else holds :3000/:3001,
or `DEV_UI_PORT`/`DEV_API_PORT` when set in the shell or `.dev.vars` — `scripts/lib/dev-ports.mjs`
is the one reader, and `APP_URL` must follow the UI port by hand because the Worker cannot read the
shell; outside production CORS/CSRF also allow the loopback twin of `APP_URL` and of the request's
own loopback origin, so nothing else changes),
then supervises `wrangler dev` and Vite ITSELF (no `concurrently`: two children of one node
process is a tree that can be killed, and it lets the script own the output) — a spinner while
they boot, then ONE ready line with the Vite URL, then only app logs, warnings and errors
(wrangler's twice-printed bindings table, its Local-Explorer banner and its copies of requests the
app already logged are filtered; `DEV_VERBOSE=1` or `--verbose` prints every raw line, and
`pnpm dev:api` / `pnpm dev:ui` run either server unfiltered). Ctrl-C, SIGTERM and a child that
dies during boot all go through one `shutdown` — children signalled, then the repo swept, so no
`workerd` is orphaned; a child that dies AFTER ready restarts in 2 s. `pnpm dev:stop` kills the
tree supervisor-FIRST and loops (SIGTERM pass, then SIGKILL passes) until the repo is quiet — a
supervisor can respawn a child between passes and `workerd` often needs the SIGKILL —
and `pnpm dev:status` prints the tree with the port holders. Vite is `strictPort`: a Vite that
quietly moved to :3001 would serve the UI from the API's port and proxy to itself. Ownership is by
command line or cwd inside this repo, and only a `--start` supervisor counts (so a second
terminal's `--stop` is never a target), which is why another checkout on :3001 is reported, never
killed:

```bash
# Fire a cron (wrangler 4.x; the older /cdn-cgi/handler/scheduled path is rewritten to this):
curl "http://localhost:3001/cdn-cgi/local/scheduled?cron=0+4+*+*+*"     # nightly prune
curl "http://localhost:3001/cdn-cgi/local/scheduled?cron=15+*+*+*+*"    # the analytics plugin's fact rebuild
# Alternative: `wrangler dev --test-scheduled` exposes /__scheduled?cron=…
# For ONE organisation: `pnpm cli analytics refresh-facts`, then `pnpm cli analytics check-facts`
# (exit 1 when a table is stale) or GET /api/analytics/facts/status (admin+).
# Queues: there is no local HTTP trigger. wrangler dev runs the consumer IN-PROCESS, so any producer
# call from the running worker is delivered locally: invite someone (POST /api/invitations from the
# People page) and watch the same terminal print `queue: processing jobs batch` → `[email:dev] …
# Link: <accept url>` → `jobs: done`. For deterministic runs call `processJobsBatch` from a test with
# a hand-built MessageBatch (tests/api/jobs-consumer.test.ts).
# Durable Object: the /ws upgrade (101) only works under wrangler dev / deployed — Node's fetch
# rejects status 101, so tests/api/notifications-hub.test.ts covers the RPC methods and the 400
# guards with a fake DurableObjectState, and tests/api/ws.test.ts stops at the forwarded request
# (the bindings stub answers 501). Open the UI against :3001 and look for the green header dot.
# R2: `wrangler dev` emulates the FILES bucket locally (state under .wrangler/); nothing to create.
# Workflows: `wrangler dev` runs AgentRunWorkflow instances locally — POST /api/agents/runs from the
# running worker (or the UI) and watch the same terminal log `agent-run: …`; the row moves
# queued → running → succeeded and `GET /api/agents/runs/<id>` lists its events. Inspect deployed ones with
pnpm --filter @launch/web exec wrangler workflows instances describe launch-agent-run <runId>
# Workers AI: `wrangler dev` proxies the `AI` binding to Cloudflare (a logged-in account; the calls are
# real). Tests never touch it — `RecordingAi` answers deterministic vectors (.claude/rules/testing.md).
# Offline switch: `pnpm bootstrap --offline` / `--online` (toggleAiBlock in scripts/lib/bootstrap-lib.mjs
# comments the [ai] block out of BOTH tomls, or restores it, text-level — parity stays green because
# the block is absent from both). `pnpm typecheck` then regenerates worker-configuration.d.ts without
# `AI`: never commit that diff — run `--online` first.
```

`pnpm --filter @launch/web exec wrangler tail [-c wrangler.staging.toml]` streams deployed logs; `[observability.logs]` is on.

## Provisioning (`apps/web/scripts/provision.ts`, `scripts/cf-provision.sh`)

The tomls are patched at the **string level only**: `wrangler --update-config` refuses the
commented TOML the kit ships and re-serialising through a TOML library drops every comment, so
`scripts/provision/patch-toml.ts` (anchored regexes, every other byte preserved, idempotent, a
different existing id refused unless `--force`) is the one writer of ids, `APP_URL`, `EMAIL_FROM`,
the `routes` line and the database driver (`DATABASE_DRIVER` plus the `[[hyperdrive]]` block, added
under `postgres` and removed under `neon`, in BOTH tomls — `pnpm provision cloudflare <env> --driver
neon|postgres`, D35) — `cf-provision.sh --apply` calls it; nobody hand-types an id. (The only other
programmatic toml writer is `toggleAiBlock` above, same byte-preserving rule.) Worker secrets go in
over stdin (`wrangler secret put NAME` reads stdin when it is not a TTY — never `--body`, never
`secret bulk`), including a `neon` Worker's `DATABASE_URL` (the pooled Neon URI, put by `secrets`
and `deploy`; `--rotate` re-puts it where `postgres` updates the Hyperdrive config); the vendor tokens are read from the environment first, then `apps/web/.provision.env`
(git-ignored, 0600, written by `pnpm provision tokens` — TTY only, hidden input, verified per vendor —
never `.dev.vars`, which `wrangler dev` loads into the Worker); every printed line passes the
ONE `redact()` in `scripts/provision/redact.ts` (connection strings, `re_*`, `napi_*`, bearer tokens,
40+ hex — the 32-hex resource ids stay readable on purpose).
