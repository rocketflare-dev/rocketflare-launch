# UI Patterns

React 18 + Vite, DaisyUI 5 on Tailwind v4, React Router v6, TanStack Query 5, zustand only for the
websocket store. Served as Workers Static Assets from the same Worker as the API (SPA fallback).
Dev: Vite on :3000 proxies `/api`, `/auth`, `/ws` — plus every prefix an installed plugin declares
(the analytics plugin's `/cubejs-api` and `/mcp`, added by hand on install) — to `wrangler dev` on :3001.
Either port moves with `DEV_UI_PORT` / `DEV_API_PORT` (`scripts/lib/dev-ports.mjs`, shell or
`.dev.vars`); `DEV_ALLOWED_HOSTS` adds hostnames Vite answers for.

## Design tokens, not raw colours

- Themes are two `@plugin "daisyui/theme"` blocks in `apps/web/src/ui/index.css` (`launch-light` default,
  `launch-dark` prefersdark). The brand variables at the top of that file are the ONLY place a hex
  appears. Components use DaisyUI semantic classes (`bg-base-200`, `text-primary`) or the kit's
  surface/border/text tokens (`--surface-panel`, `--border-subtle`, `.text-muted`); **never
  `bg-blue-50`-style palette utilities**
- `apps/web/tests/ui/contrast.test.ts` gates the emitted tokens (WCAG); if you change a colour, run it
- `ThemeToggle` sets `data-theme` on `<html>`; the DOM attribute is the state, mirrored to
  `localStorage['theme']` and validated on read (`index.html` pre-hydration script)
- Tailwind v4 content scanning: `index.css` starts with `@import "tailwindcss" source(none)` and then
  explicit `@source "./index.html"` / `@source "./**/*.{ts,tsx}"` — scoped to `apps/web/src/ui`.
  **Lesson**: without `source(none)` v4 auto-detects sources from the package root and scans the whole
  repo — docs, API code, tests, migrations — and DaisyUI emits a component for every stray word that
  looks like a class (`card`, `table`, `menu` in a comment). Keep the scan scoped. A dependency that
  ships pre-built JSX **and uncompiled Tailwind classes** is an explicit `@source` line pointing at
  its dist. drizzle-cube (the analytics plugin's) is NOT such a dependency: its styles are
  precompiled and `dc:`-prefixed in `drizzle-cube/client/styles.css`, loaded by that plugin's lazy
  chunk, so scanning its dist generated zero of its classes and a pile of stray DaisyUI components —
  pure cost, measured, then removed. An installed plugin's own pages DO need a line, and there is
  one: `@source "../plugins/**/ui/**/*.{ts,tsx}"` — without it a plugin page renders unstyled with
  nothing in the console to say why. Never
  `@source` node_modules without measuring the output first. Safelist (`@source inline(...)`) only classes built from
  props (`alert-*`, `btn-*`), never from data or from a dependency
- Fonts self-hosted via `@fontsource` imports in `main.tsx`

## Providers (06 §b)

`ErrorBoundary` → `QueryClientProvider` → `AuthProvider` → `AbilityProvider` → `WebSocketProvider` →
`BrowserRouter` → routes. `Layout` is mounted once under `/*`; a second `ErrorBoundary` wraps each
`<main>`. Dev-only `ReactQueryDevtools` in a `Suspense`.

## Data layer

- All HTTP via `lib/api-client.ts` (`api.get/post/patch/delete/upload`): `credentials: 'include'`, typed
  `ApiError` from the shared envelope, `schema` option zod-parses the response with the same
  `@launch/shared/<module>` schema the server validates with (import from `@launch/shared/...`, never a
  relative path into `packages/`). No `hono/client` RPC (D13)
- Files (D23): `api.upload(url, formData, { schema })` posts multipart **without** a JSON
  `Content-Type` (the browser sets the boundary). Check `isAvatarMimeType` / `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` from
  `@launch/shared/files` client-side first (`validateAvatarFile` in `hooks/useProfile.ts`) so the
  server's 413/415 are a backstop, not the UX; `useUploadAvatar()` → `POST /api/files?scope=avatars`
  then invalidates `me` + `auth` and refreshes the session. Render `<img src={user.avatarUrl}>` with
  an `onError` fallback to initials — the object is tenant-scoped, the URL is not
- One hook file per resource in `hooks/use<Resource>.ts`; query keys from the central `queryKeys`
  factory in `lib/query-keys.ts` — never inline key arrays. `lib/queryClient.ts` holds the client
  and its global `QueryCache.onError`
- `queryOptions()` factories in `lib/query-options.ts` for anything used by more than one component
- Mutations invalidate via `queryKeys`; error toast on by default (`showToast`)
- **Polling rules** (Phase 3b): poll only while the server still owes an answer, with the decision as a
  pure function on the cached row — `refetchInterval: q => runPollInterval(q.state.data?.status)`
  (`RUN_POLL_MS` 3 s while **`runOwesAnswer`**, which is `queued || running` and deliberately NOT
  `isRunActive` — that includes `awaiting_input`, and a run parked on a person would otherwise be
  re-fetched every three seconds for the length of `AGENT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT`, by every open tab;
  lists poll while any listed row owes an answer); documents 5 s
  (`DOCUMENT_POLL_MS`) while a row is `pending`. Polling is the belt to the nudge's braces — a resource
  that has a server nudge still polls (the socket may be down); a resource without one (documents) polls
  only. Never poll a settled row, never poll unconditionally, never fight `refetchInterval` with timers in tests
- Global 401: `QueryCache.onError` clears the client and redirects to `/login?returnUrl=` (D20)
- Pagination meta is `{ page, pageSize, total, totalPages }`; `PaginationControls` consumes it

## State

TanStack Query owns server state. zustand owns exactly one thing: the websocket connection state
(`stores/websocketStore.ts`: `status: 'connecting' | 'open' | 'closed'`, `connectedAt`,
`disconnectedAt` — kept at the FIRST drop so the banner measures the whole outage — `attempt`,
`lastEvent`; written only by `lib/websocketClient.ts`). Component-local UI state is `useState`;
theme and density are DOM attributes. Do not add a store for server data.

## Realtime (D8)

`lib/websocketClient.ts` singleton (outside React) connects to `/ws?tenantId=` (same origin — the
Vite proxy forwards it in dev); reconnects with exponential backoff (base `min(1 s · 2^attempt,
30 s)`, jittered in `[base/2, base]`), and a close with code 1001/1012 or reason "upgraded"/"new
version" (Worker redeployed) reconnects in 100 ms without counting as a failure; sends
`{"type":"ping"}` every 30 s. Events are parsed with `realtimeEventSchema`; the event type → query-key
root map is **`REALTIME_INVALIDATIONS` / `invalidationsFor()` in `@launch/shared/realtime`**, not in
the UI — a new server event type adds its roots there, and `tests/ui` asserts every root is a real
`queryKeys` family (`['invitations']`, `['pending-invitations']`, `['members']`, `['tenant']`…).
**Convention: the `entity` string of an `entity.changed { entity, id }` nudge IS the query-key family
root** — `invalidationsFor()` returns `[[entity]]`, so a resource whose server nudges
`entity: 'agent-run'` names its family `['agent-run']` (`queryKeys.agentRuns.all`) and gets live
refresh with zero hook-side socket code. When you add a resource: pick the root first, use the same
string in the service's nudge and in `query-keys.ts`, and never subscribe to the socket from a hook.
`components/WebSocketProvider.tsx` (after `AbilityProvider`) connects once `useAuth()` is
authenticated with a tenant, reconnects on tenant switch, disconnects on sign-out, and uses
`useQueryClient()` to `invalidateQueries({ queryKey })` per root, toasting `notification.created`.
Components subscribe to query state, never to the socket; `WebSocketStatus` (header dot) and
`ConnectionBanner` (after 5 s degraded) read the store only. Tests inject a fake socket with
`websocketClient.setFactory()` — reset it in `afterEach`.

## Streaming (AG-UI over SSE, D17)

- SSE is consumed with **`fetch`, never `EventSource`** (GET-only, cannot carry the CSRF header): `lib/aguiStream.ts`
  POSTs with `credentials: 'include'` + `X-Requested-With` and reads the body through `lib/sse.ts`
  (`readSse(response, parse, onEvent, { signal })`, `SseFrameBuffer` survives frames split across
  chunks, each `data` goes through the parser the CALLER passes — `kitAguiEventSchema.safeParse` —
  and unknown frames are dropped, never thrown). **Spec AG-UI frames carry no `event:` line**; the
  type is inside the JSON, so nothing may key on the SSE event field. `lib/sse.ts` imports no
  schema, which is what keeps `@ag-ui/core` out of the eager shell. The run READ-stream
  (`lib/runAguiStream.ts` → `hooks/useRunStream.ts`) is the one GET — deliberately, so a third-party
  client can point a bare `EventSource` at it — resuming with `?afterSeq=`, which beats an inbound
  `Last-Event-ID` when both arrive. Reconnection lives in the HOOK, not the transport.
- **A read-stream that carries DURABLE rows writes them into the cache; only chat's in-flight text
  is local state.** `useRunStream` is the ONLY writer of `['agent-run-agui', id]`, and that key must
  stay out of `REALTIME_INVALIDATIONS` — a nudge that invalidated it would wipe a live timeline with
  the very message telling it to refresh. Merge purely (the timeline model is idempotent under
  duplicated events), never append blindly.
- **A read-stream closing with no terminal event means RECONNECT, not error** — redeploy, idle cap,
  duration cap, transport error, abort all look the same, deliberately. That is the inverse of the
  chat write-stream, where the stream IS the run and a failure is a `RUN_ERROR`.
  It does not go through `api-client`'s `request()` (JSON only) but reuses `parseErrorBody`: a pre-stream
  non-2xx is the shared envelope — 503 `ai_not_configured` becomes `AiNotConfiguredError` so the page
  renders a "configure AI" call to action instead of a toast
- **Streaming text is the one exception to "server data lives only in the cache"**: `useSendMessage`
  appends the user bubble optimistically, accumulates the assistant reply in LOCAL state from
  `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` deltas — across every message id the run opens, one per model turn (not
  truth until `RUN_FINISHED`) — then writes the finished message into the cache (the server persisted
  it BEFORE that frame) and invalidates the `chat.conversations` family. Stop =
  `AbortController.abort()` — **a cancelled run emits NO terminal event**, which is the protocol's
  way of saying the client went away: a normal end, no toast, no error bubble; a pre-stream failure
  takes the optimistic bubble back; a `RUN_ERROR` leaves the turn in `error` status until the next send
- Frame order the UI relies on: `RUN_STARTED` → `CUSTOM kit.chat.ids` (swap the optimistic user id
  for `userMessageId`) → `STATE_SNAPSHOT` → per model turn `TEXT_MESSAGE_START → CONTENT* → END`
  and `TOOL_CALL_START → ARGS → END → RESULT` → `CUSTOM kit.usage` → `RUN_FINISHED`. Tool calls
  render as one-liners through `toolLabel(name)`. A new event is an AG-UI type added to
  `kitAguiEventSchema`, or a member of the kit's CUSTOM namespace, in
  `@launch/shared/ai/agui` first — an APP adds its own CUSTOM events under its own prefix,
  never `kit.`
- Guards: `/chat/:conversationId?` is `read Conversation` (every role; ownership is server-side);
  `/settings` (`?tab=ai|prompts|agent-models|usage`) is `guard="admin"`, the last two additionally
  `manage AiConfig`. Agent runs (`/agents`, `/agents/runs/:runId`, `AgentRun`), documents
  (`/documents`, `Document`) and the agent-models tab follow the same contracts
  (`@launch/shared/ai/{agents,embeddings,agent-models,interrupts,artifacts}`). Documents
  poll/nudge; **a run STREAMS** (below) and `entity.changed { entity: 'agent-run' }` invalidates the
  run query — but never `['agent-run-agui']`. Page specifics: `apps/web/src/ui/CLAUDE.md`

## Auth and guards

- `hooks/useAuth.tsx` wraps `GET /auth/session` (zod-parsed) and exposes `useTenancyMode()` so
  single-tenant deployments hide `OrgSwitcher`, `/select-tenant` and org create/delete (D25)
- One guard primitive, `RequireGuard` (`components/RequireGuard.tsx`), composed into coarse role
  guards (authenticated, owner/admin, global admin) and fine ability guards (`RequireAbility`,
  `<Can I="manage" a="Tenant">` from `components/permissions/`). `SideNav` item flags use the SAME
  guard as the page they open; `ProtectedRoute` requires a tenant for the whole shell EXCEPT
  `/admin/*` for a global admin (no membership needed — `useNavGuard` then passes only
  `'globalAdmin'` guards, so nothing tenant-scoped is linked)
- OAuth is a full-page redirect to `/auth/:provider?returnUrl=`; magic link via
  `POST /auth/magic-link/request`; `GET /auth/methods` drives which buttons render. `oidcOnly`
  auto-redirects to `/auth/oidc` — never on `?signedOut=1` / `?error=` / `?as=`, which would loop
- `/login?as=<email>` signs in through `POST /auth/dev-login` on mount, ONLY when `methods.devLogin`
  is true and the email is in `DEV_ACCOUNTS` (the bootstrap opens it); never widen the allow-list

## Conventions

- Pages in `pages/` (lazy in `App.tsx`), reusable primitives in `components/shared/` — check there
  before writing a modal, empty state, toast, pagination control or section panel
- **A surface somebody is asked to ACT on is a page, not a modal.** A run
  (`/agents/runs/:runId`, issue #17) is arrived at from a notification, may need a document read
  before deciding, and is left and returned to — so it has its own route, its own lazy chunk, a
  breadcrumb, and no `role="dialog"`. The decision panel is pinned ABOVE the content, **focus lands
  on its heading and never on the destructive button**, and a non-approver sees one sentence rather
  than a disabled control with a tooltip. A conflict (409) is rendered as `alert-info` plus a
  refetch — *information, not an error*: no toast and no red for "somebody else got there first"
- **A countdown chooses its own tick rate from a pure function.** `expiryState(expiresAt, now) →
  { tickMs }` — a second under an hour, a minute under a day, `null` beyond. A naive one-second
  interval on a seven-day deadline is ~600 000 re-renders of a panel nobody is watching
- **A growing list windows; it does not virtualise.** Render the last N groups plus one "show
  earlier" button. Virtualising needs measurement, and measurement fights both auto-scroll and
  collapsible rows. Auto-scroll fires only when the reader is at the bottom AND the last row's **id**
  changed — keying on height yanks them down whenever they expand something old
- **A live count in the nav is `NavItem.badgeKey` resolved in `SideNav`**, never a hook inside
  `navigationConfig`: that const is plain data consumed by the pure, tested `filterNavConfig`. Feed
  it from a query-key root the server already nudges — **never a poll** — and **render a dot on the
  icon when the nav is collapsed**, or the badge is invisible to everyone who collapsed the sidebar
- **A notification's `data` is its deep link.** One `notificationLink(notification)` helper mapping
  `type` + `data` → a path (unknown → `null`), used by the bell AND the list, so a row means the
  same thing in both places
- `components/ai/` (`Markdown`, `ChatBubble`) is deliberately NOT exported from the
  `components/shared` barrel that `App.tsx` imports eagerly: `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` must ship
  only in the lazy chat / agents / documents chunks, never the main bundle. Import them by path from
  lazy pages ONLY — `pages/chat/**`, `pages/agents/**` and `pages/documents/DocumentViewPage.tsx`:
  `DocumentsPage` and `SearchPage` live in that folder too and must NOT import it. The converse rule
  holds for `components/shared`, nothing under which may import a markdown renderer — which is why
  `DocumentCard` renders its excerpt as plain text (`tests/config/ui-bundle.test.ts` asserts both
  halves);
  render model output through `Markdown` (`skipHtml`, links `noopener`), never
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; user text renders verbatim (`whitespace-pre-wrap`). `pages/agents/**`
  imports `Markdown` too and is lazy for the same reason (Vite emits one shared `Markdown-*.js`)
- **A plugin's heavy dependencies stay in its own lazy chunk (D19, D31)**: the analytics plugin's
  `drizzle-cube/client`, `recharts`, `d3`, `react-grid-layout` and `react-is` are reached only from
  its own pages and components, never from the `components/shared` barrel, `App.tsx`, `SideNav` or a
  hook the shell loads eagerly. Its `ui/index.ts` ships in the MAIN bundle — every page is
  `lazy(() => import(...))` and `tests/config/plugins.test.ts` reads that file's SOURCE to prove it.
  Two more boundaries the same rule implies: a registry the browser reads must be a separate file
  from the one that composes other plugins' contributions (importing the composing one drags
  `postgres` into the UI bundle — measured), and a plugin's own CSS is imported beside the library's
  in its lazy component, never added to `index.css`. When you touch an import, compare
  `pnpm web build:ui` output before and after — the delta is the check, not any figure a doc could
  quote — and `grep recharts dist/ui/assets/index-*.js` must stay at 0
- **Third-party providers with their own TanStack Query** (drizzle-cube does this): the app's global
  `QueryCache.onError` never sees their failures. Wrap them (the analytics plugin's `CubeClientProvider`)
  with a dedicated `QueryClient` whose `onError` maps 401 → `notifyUnauthorized`, and pass cookie auth
  explicitly (`credentials: 'include'`, `X-Requested-With`). Kit hooks rendered inside still resolve the
  app's client.
- **Dashboards** (the analytics plugin's, D31): edit mode autosaves the whole config (debounced 1.5 s PATCH); there is no router-level
  unsaved-changes blocker — `beforeunload` while dirty plus a flush when leaving edit mode/unmount.
  `useFactTableStatus({ enabled })` MUST be gated on `manage Dashboard` (admin-only endpoint).
  `syncDarkClass` mirrors `data-theme="launch-dark"` into a `dark` class only while an analytics surface is
  mounted (drizzle-cube detects `.dark`); kit CSS never reads `.dark`. `@nivo/heatmap` is aliased in
  `vite.config.ts` to a stub the PLUGIN ships — one of the two core lines its install prints, since
  a plugin edits no core file — see `docs/ADAPTING.md` §3b to enable heat maps.
- **Visibility (D29)**: `AccessPicker` / `AccessBadge` / `VisibilityModal` in `components/shared` are
  the ONE wording of "who can see this" — they are markdown-free by construction, which is what lets
  them live in the eager barrel. Render them only where the save would succeed (owner or
  `manage Document`; `manage Dashboard`), and offer an admin every group and a member only their own
  (`useMyGroups`) — the same rule `resolveRequestedVisibility` applies, so the picker cannot offer
  what the API would refuse. An EMPTY selection is WARNED about, never blocked: "only me and admins"
  is a real answer and the state a deleted group leaves behind
- **Feature flags (D30)**: gate with `{ feature: 'x' }` as a `NavGuard`, or `useFeature('x')` — both
  read `session.features`. **Never `{ action: 'access', subject: 'Feature:x' }`**: a global admin's
  `manage all` satisfies the CASL form, so they would see a nav item whose routes the server 404s.
  A `NavGuard` may be a LIST meaning AND, which is how a flag composes with a permission
  (`featureGuard(MY_FEATURE, { action: 'read', subject: 'Thing' })`) — the flag and the permission
  stay two readable facts instead of one conflated subject. One const per feature, so the nav, the
  routes and the settings tabs cannot drift — in `lib/feature-guards.ts` for an app's own flag
  (the kit ships none there now; that file exports only `featureGuard`), and beside the route and
  nav item it gates for a plugin's (D31). All of it is cosmetic: the gated code still ships in the
  bundle, and the server is the protection
- Forms validate with the `@launch/shared` schema the server uses; show `FieldError` per field
- Icons: `@heroicons/react`. No new UI library without a stated reason in the PR
- `EnvironmentBadge` + `useEnvironmentTitle` read `APP_ENV`/`RELEASE_VERSION` from `/auth/session`;
  staging must look different from production

## Plugins (D31) — `UiPlugin`, `src/plugins/ui.ts`

A plugin's UI half is `apps/web/src/plugins/<id>/ui/index.ts`, and that file is the whole of what
the eager shell sees. The rules follow from that one fact:

- **The UI kit is two modules, and which one you may import depends on where you are.**
  `@/plugins/api/ui-wiring` is the WIRING half — `NavItem`, `NavGroup`, `NavGuard`, `TabConfig`,
  `QuickLink`, `useNavGuard`, `featureGuard` — and is the only host module a plugin's `ui/index.ts`
  may import, because that file ships in the MAIN bundle for every reader including the ones who
  never open the plugin. `@/plugins/api/ui` is the COMPONENTS half, for a lazy PAGE: all of
  `components/shared`, `LoadingIndicator`, `showToast` (exported once, from here — the kit reaches
  it by two public paths and one plugin took each, which is how two call sites of one function come
  to look like two functions) and `SideNav` itself, for the test that drives the REAL nav rather
  than a re-implementation of its guards. This is not new policy: `uiEntryIssues` always drew this
  line, and now there is a module on each side of it
- **`routes` are per tier** (`shell` — the default, inside `Layout` with a tenant — `noTenant`,
  `public`) and every `Component` is `lazy(() => import('./pages/X'))`. A statically imported page
  puts the plugin in the main bundle for readers who never open it; `tests/config/plugins.test.ts`
  reads the SOURCE of the UI entry and enforces both halves — an import allowlist (`react`, the
  heroicons set, `@launch/shared/*`, `@/plugins/types`, `@/plugins/api/ui-wiring`,
  `@/ui/components/SideNav`,
  `@/ui/hooks/useNavGuard`, `@/ui/lib/feature-guards`; type-only imports are unrestricted because
  they are erased) and "every dynamic `import()` is inside `lazy(() => …)`"
- **The route's guard and its nav item's guard are the SAME object**, declared once beside them, so
  a link can never point at a page its reader cannot open — `EXAMPLE_FEATURE_GUARD` is the pattern
- **`nav` is a list of GROUPS**, spliced by `composeNav(CORE_NAVIGATION, …)`: `before: '<label>'`
  inserts before that core group (the kit's own default is "Organisation"), and a group with no
  `before` lands above it, which is where an app's own features go. A label that is not found
  appends. The kit's nav literal is `CORE_NAVIGATION`; `navigationConfig` is the composed result,
  and `filterNavConfig` is unchanged — plugin items obey the same guards
- `settingsTabs(ctx)` appends tabs after the kit's (`ctx.can` is the caller's ability);
  `agentForms` is the plugin's half of `AGENT_FORMS`
- **`queryKeys` roots must start with `<id>:`** (checked by `plugins.test.ts`), so one plugin's
  invalidation can never reach another's cache. The `entity.changed` convention is unchanged and is
  what makes the socket wiring free: **the `entity` string of a nudge IS a query-key family root**,
  so declare it once — one exported constant is both the server's nudge entity and the UI's
  family root — and `invalidationsFor()` covers it with no hook-side socket code
- A plugin's own hooks read its `query-keys.ts` directly rather than the merged `queryKeys`: the
  merge is for the HOST's benefit, and a plugin must behave the same whether it is the only one
  installed or the fifth
