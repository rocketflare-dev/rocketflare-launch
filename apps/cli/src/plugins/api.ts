/**
 * The CLI plugin API (D31) — what a plugin's command module imports from the kit.
 *
 * The rule a plugin's CLI half keeps is the one every kit command keeps: **it owns no second copy
 * of the contract.** It calls the plugin's own routes through `requireClient(ctx).request(...)` and
 * parses the response with the same `@launch/shared` schema the server validated with. It
 * builds no envelopes, constructs no URLs by hand, and never calls `fetch`.
 *
 * It also never prints an error and never calls `process.exit`. It throws `CliError`; `cli.ts`
 * catches once, prints once, and sets `process.exitCode` — which is what makes every command
 * testable in-process, and what keeps the four exit codes (0 ok · 1 error · 2 not logged in ·
 * 3 forbidden) one mapping rather than one per command.
 *
 * `process.env` is legitimate in this package — it is Node — but it is read in `config.ts` and
 * nowhere else, a plugin's commands included. Everything environmental arrives on the context.
