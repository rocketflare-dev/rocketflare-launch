/**
 * `describeCases(name, { harness, judges, cases })` (D33) — `describeEval` once per case, each with
 * only the judges that case gives something to check (`EvalJudge.appliesTo`). vitest-evals averages
 * a `null` score as 0, so a suite-wide judge list would fail a greeting for having no
 * `expected.contains`; attaching per case keeps every average honest. Every block shares the suite
 * name, so reports and baselines still read `<suite> › <case id>`.
