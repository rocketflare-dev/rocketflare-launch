/**
 * What an eval run is configured with (D33). `scripts/eval.mjs` loads `apps/web/.env.test` (the
 * test database on :5433) and the AI keys from `apps/web/.dev.vars` into `process.env`, plus the
 * flags as `EVAL_*`; this module reads them once.
 *
 * Models resolve through the kit's own resolver, so a suite exercises the same chain production
 * does: the platform `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, pinned per prompt key through `agent_models` when
 * `--model` is given. Without a key there is nothing to evaluate, and every suite SKIPS with the
 * reason instead of failing — `createTestEnv` would otherwise hand the resolver the test `AI` stub,
 * which answers chat with canned text and would score as a real (and terrible) model.
 * `--provider fireworks|gemini` puts the target on a tenant `ai_configs` row instead
 * (`providers.ts`); `--judge-provider` does the same for the judge.
