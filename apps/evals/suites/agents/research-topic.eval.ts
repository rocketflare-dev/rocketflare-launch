/**
 * The `research-topic` agent (D33): a tool loop over the knowledge base ending in one
 * `submit_answer`. It must search (`Trajectory`), answer in the declared shape (`Schema`), ground
 * every claim in the passages it read (`Faithfulness` — a run's `tool.end` events keep a
 * 600-character preview per passage, which is what the judge sees), and meet the case's rubric.
 * A run that parks on `ask_human` scores as a miss: an eval cannot answer it.
