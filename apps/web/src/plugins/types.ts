/**
 * The Worker half of a plugin (D31): what a plugin contributes to the server and to the UI.
 *
 * Both interfaces are generic over the plugin's `SharedPlugin` so that `jobHandlers`, `agents` and
 * `prompts` are checked for exhaustiveness against the keys that same plugin declared — one
 * plugin's missing handler is a type error in the plugin, not a runtime dispatch failure in the
 * host. The host's side of the same bargain is the merged table's cast: each half is checked where
 * it is declared, and only the join is asserted.
 *
 * **This file names the agent runtime, which is a deletable surface.** `AnyAgentDefinition`,
 * `AgentToolContext` and `AgentForm` all live inside `feature-agents`, so this file is listed in
 * that surface's registries in the kit's manifest: an app that deletes the agent runtime
 * deletes the four fields below too, exactly as they already delete lines from `worker.ts`,
 * `api/index.ts` and `App.tsx`. The alternative — restating a structural agent type here so the
 * seam survives on its own — was rejected because it buys nothing: the real types are what makes
 * `agents: Record<AgentKeyOf<S>, …>` an exhaustiveness check rather than a shape a plugin can get
 * subtly wrong, and a restated one would be a second definition to keep in step.
