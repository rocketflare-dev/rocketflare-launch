/**
 * `/api/hooks/example-feature` (D34) — the reference plugin's PUBLIC mount.
 *
 *   GET    /ping?state=…            no session — verify the signed link, enqueue the smoke job, 202
 *
 * The shape every consent callback and webhook takes, small enough to read in one go:
 *
 * 1. **Prove who is calling** before touching anything. Here that is `verifyState` over a token the
 *    authed `POST /ping-link` minted; a webhook would compare a stored secret or check the
 *    provider's signature instead. Every failure is the same 401 — the caller learns nothing about
 *    WHICH check it failed.
 * 2. **Only then name a tenant**, and only the one the proof carried. `PublicCtx` has no ambient
 *    tenant on purpose.
 * 3. **Re-check the flag** with `ctx.features(tenantId)`: the authed mount's `requireFeature` gate
 *    cannot run here (there is no `auth.features`), so a surface that has gone dark since the link
 *    was minted would otherwise still answer.
 * 4. **Enqueue and answer fast** — the provider on the other end of a real webhook counts seconds.
