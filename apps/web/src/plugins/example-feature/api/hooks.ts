/**
 * The plugin's lifecycle hooks (D31): what a new organisation starts with, and what
 * `pnpm seed --demo` fills in.
 *
 * Both obey the kit's hook contract, which is one sentence: **idempotent, post-commit,
 * best-effort.** `onTenantCreated` runs outside the create transaction and its failure is swallowed
 * by the host, so it must never be the only way a tenant gets something it needs — here the welcome
 * note is decoration, and a tenant without one works perfectly. `seedDemo` is handed a `demoId`
 * already namespaced with the plugin's id, so two plugins that both seed `note:1` cannot collide
 * and re-running the seed adds nothing.
 *
 * Note what `HookCtx` does NOT carry: a logger, an `env`, a way to enqueue or nudge. A hook runs at
 * somebody else's transaction boundary and has no business doing any of that — if it needs to, it is
 * not a hook.

 *
 * The flag row belongs to whatever SHIPS the flag, which is this plugin: a kit with this plugin
 * removed must not seed state for a key no code reads. `feature_flags` is the KIT's table, though,
 * so it is reached through `allTables()` — the declared way to name the merged schema — and
