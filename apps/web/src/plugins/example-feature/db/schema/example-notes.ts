/**
 * `example_notes` (D31) — the reference plugin's one table, and the proof that a plugin can own
 * tenant data on the same terms as the kit.
 *
 * Everything here is the kit's schema convention, unchanged, because that is the point: `tenantRef()`
 * first so the FK and the cascade are spelled once, `timestamps()` for `timestamptz` columns, every
 * index led by `tenant_id`, and `tenantIsolation()` so the RLS policy exists whether or not
 * `TENANT_SCOPE_MODE` is ever flipped to `enforce`. `rls-coverage.test.ts` reads the catalog, so a
 * plugin table with no policy fails the host's suite exactly as a kit one would.
 *
 * The only plugin-specific rule is the NAME: a prefix derived from the plugin's id — its first
 * hyphen-separated segment, so `example-feature` owns `example_*` — kept distinct from every other
 * installed plugin's. The prefix is a convention rather than something the tooling derives, and the
 * part that IS enforced is the collision: `pnpm plugin check` fails when two installed plugins
 * declare one table name. Nothing else would see it — TS2308 catches a duplicated EXPORT symbol on
 * the `export *` line, not a duplicated `pgTable('…')`, which compiles and then emits DDL twice.
 *
 * `ownerUserId` is nullable and `onDelete: 'set null'`: a note outlives the person who wrote it, and
 * the route's own-row check reads `null` as "nobody owns this", which only admins may then edit.
 * `relations()` names this plugin's OWN tables only — see `apps/web/src/plugins/schema.ts` for why
 * a second `relations()` over a core table silently breaks `with:` app-wide.
