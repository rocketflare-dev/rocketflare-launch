/**
 * `example-feature` — the reference plugin's SERVER entry (D31, decision 3).
 *
 * One of the four published files a plugin has (this, `./ui`, the shared entry and the CLI one);
 * everything else under this directory is private, which is what lets the plugin's own semver cover
 * a knowable surface. `tests/config/plugins.test.ts` enforces that: nothing outside the plugin may
 * name a file inside it except the five barrel lines.
 *
 * Read this file top to bottom and you have the whole server half: which prefix it mounts and
 * behind which gate, which job types it handles, which tools it gives every agent run, what a new
 * organisation and the demo seed get, and which CASL rules it adds. The host merges each of those
 * into a kit registry it cannot otherwise be edited into.
 *
 * **It is also the boundary.** The registration slots below are the kit's shapes, and the plugin's
 * own code is written against the plugin surface — so the adapters (`toolCtx`, and the two hook
 * spreads) are called here, once each, and nowhere else. That is the sentence the whole contract
 * makes true: *a plugin imports only from declared entries, and receives everything else as
 * injected context.*
