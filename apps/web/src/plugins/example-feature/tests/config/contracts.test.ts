/**
 * The reference plugin's own contracts (D31) — pure, no database, no app.
 *
 * What it pins is the half of a plugin that the HOST cannot check for it: that every key this
 * plugin declares carries its id, that its declarations actually reach the kit's merged registries
 * once the barrel line exists, and that its request contracts refuse the bodies its routes rely on
 * being refused. `tests/config/plugins.test.ts` proves the structural rules for every plugin; this
 * proves this one's.
