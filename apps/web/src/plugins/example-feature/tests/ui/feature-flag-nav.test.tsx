/**
 * The nav side of a feature flag (D30, D31), driven through the REAL `useNavGuard`.
 *
 * It lives inside the plugin because the item it looks for is the plugin's: the flag, the nav
 * entry, the route and the page all arrive and leave together, and a test that outlived them would
 * be a false failure the day somebody runs `pnpm plugin remove example-feature`. What it exercises
 * is the KIT's guard, through `SideNav`, with this plugin's group spliced in by `composeNav` — so
 * it is also the proof that a plugin's nav item obeys exactly the rules a kit one does.
 *
 * Driving the real hook is the whole point. An app on this kit wrote this test against a
 * re-implementation of the guard logic, and the re-implementation is precisely what hid the bug it
 * was meant to catch: the server gate read the CASL ability, where a global admin's `manage all`
 * satisfies every `Feature:` subject, so unreleased routes were open to platform staff. Anything
 * here that re-derives what the hook does is worthless.
 *
 * So: every assertion runs for an OWNER (who holds every tenant permission) and for a GLOBAL ADMIN
 * (who holds `manage all`). Neither may see a surface whose flag is off.
