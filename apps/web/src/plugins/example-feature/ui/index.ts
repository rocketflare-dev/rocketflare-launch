/**
 * `example-feature` — the reference plugin's UI entry (D31).
 *
 * **This file ships in the MAIN bundle**, because `App.tsx` and `SideNav` import the barrel that
 * imports it, for every reader — including the ones who never open the plugin. So it wires things
 * up and nothing else: the page arrives as `lazy(() => import(...))`, and the only host module it
 * may import is `@/plugins/api/ui-wiring` — the WIRING half of the UI kit, which is types, one
 * helper and one hook. The COMPONENTS half (`@/plugins/api/ui`) is deliberately unreachable from
 * here; that is for a lazy PAGE, which ships in its own chunk.
 * `tests/config/plugins.test.ts` reads this file's SOURCE and enforces both rules — a statically
 * imported page is the mistake it exists to catch.
 *
 * The route's guard and the nav item's guard are the SAME object, so a link can never point at a
 * page its reader cannot open. It is `{ feature }`, never `{ action: 'access', subject:
 * 'Feature:example-feature' }`: a global admin's `manage all` satisfies the CASL form, which would
 * show them a nav item whose routes the server 404s.
