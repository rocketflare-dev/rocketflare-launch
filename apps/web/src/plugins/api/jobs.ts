/**
 * Background work: `JobCtx` for a queue handler, `CronCtx` for a scheduled task (D7, D31).
 *
 * Both are the kit's own contexts with methods bolted on, and both keep the kit's two hard rules:
 *
 * - **Await everything. There is no `waitUntil` in a queue consumer.** A handler that defers work
 *   and returns has told the platform the message succeeded while the work is still running — and
 *   the isolate may be gone before it finishes. That is why `JobCtx` has no `defer`, where
 *   `RequestCtx` does.
 * - **Throw to retry, return to ack.** Backoff is 30 s doubling to a 15-minute cap and the toml's
 *   `max_retries` ends it. A handler that swallows its own error has converted a retryable failure
 *   into silent data loss.
 *
 * Neither context carries a `tenantId`, deliberately. A job's tenant comes from its PAYLOAD and a
 * cron task runs across every organisation, so there is no ambient tenant to reach for absently —
 * which is exactly the mistake the missing field prevents. Every method that needs one takes it.
