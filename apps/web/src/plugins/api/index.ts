/**
 * The plugin API — the ONE module a plugin's server half imports from the host (D31).
 *
 * `import { requestCtx, createRouter, validate } from '@/plugins/api'` and that is the whole of it.
 * Everything a plugin needs at RUNTIME arrives through an injected context; everything it needs to
 * NAME (a `Database` in its own service signature, a `Tool`, an `AccessScope`) is a type re-exported
 * here. The enforcement rule in `tests/helpers/plugins.ts` is the sentence this file makes true:
 * *a plugin imports only from declared entries, and receives everything else as injected context.*
 *
 * The exports below are grouped by the file they come from and sorted by the formatter, so read
 * them there: `./http` is a request, `./jobs` is background work, `./ai` is agents and tools,
 * `./access` is row visibility, `./events` is nudges and notifications, `./secrets` is a tenant's
 * credentials at rest.
 *
 * **Three things are deliberately NOT here.**
 *
 * - `./peers` — `extensions()` and `allTables()` read the whole installed set, which means this
 *   module would read the plugin barrel, which every plugin imports. Keeping it out means the
 *   common path is acyclic; importing it is then a deliberate act with its own file to explain
 *   itself.
 * - `./ui` and `./ui-wiring` — React. A plugin's server half must never pull the browser half into
 *   the Worker bundle, and the two UI halves are separately importable for a reason of their own
 *   (one ships in the main bundle, one must not).
 * - Schema helpers. `tenantRef`, `timestamps` and `tenantIsolation` are needed at MODULE scope by a
 *   table file, so they can come neither from a context nor from a module that reads the plugin
 *   barrel. They are at `@/db/schema/kit` — beside `rls.ts`, below the barrel.
