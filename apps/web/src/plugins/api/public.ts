/**
 * `PublicCtx` (D31, D34) — what a plugin's PUBLIC route handler is handed: an admin-consent
 * callback, a webhook, a push endpoint. Anything a third party calls, which carries no session and
 * no API key.
 *
 * A public mount is `ServerPlugin.publicMounts`, at `/api/hooks/<plugin id>` and beneath it, and
 * the host mounts it with NO `authMiddleware` — every other global still applies (request id,
 * logger, config, security headers, the JSON body limit, CORS, cookie-only CSRF, the per-request
 * database, the tracer). The prefix is structural rather than conventional because it is what
 * keeps the unauthenticated surface ENUMERABLE: `tests/config/plugins.test.ts` refuses a public
 * mount anywhere else, and refuses an authed mount under `/api/hooks`.
 *
 * **There is no tenant here, and that is the point of the type.** A request to a public mount has
 * not proved who it is; the handler proves it — a `verifyState` token it minted, a `clientState`
 * it stored, a signature the provider sent — and only THEN knows which organisation the request is
 * about. So nothing on this context is bound to one, every method that needs one takes it, and the
 * database handle is the unscoped one a job gets. A query in a public handler is therefore always
 * `where tenant_id = <the id the handler just proved>`, never an ambient value.
 *
 * Answer fast. A provider that sends webhooks usually wants a 2xx inside a few seconds and treats
 * a slow endpoint as a failing one (Microsoft Graph: 3 s), so the shape is verify → `enqueue` →
 * 202, with the real work in a job. That is the kit's own rule — routes enqueue, never run.
