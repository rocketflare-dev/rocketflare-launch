/**
 * `RequestCtx` (D13, D31) — everything a plugin's route handler needs, as one injected object.
 *
 * A plugin route is a kit route in every respect: `createRouter()`, `validate()` with a contract
 * from the plugin's own shared entry, an authorisation check, a tenant predicate on every query,
 * typed errors. What differs is only where it is REGISTERED (`ServerPlugin.mounts`) and how it
 * reaches the kit — through this context rather than through nine imports.
 *
 * **The adapter is the seam.** `requestCtx(c)` reads the kit's `RouteContext` and nothing else
 * reads it, which is why `cfg` can stay `cfg` inside the kit while every plugin says `config`.
 *
 * The error helpers return `never` and THROW rather than returning an error to throw, so that
 * `if (!row) ctx.notFound('Note not found')` leaves `row` non-null on the next line —
 * `throw ctx.notFound(...)` narrows too but reads worse, and `return ctx.notFound(...)` does not
 * narrow at all.
 *
 * **That narrowing needs `ctx` to be EXPLICITLY annotated**, which is the one trap in this file:
 *
 *     const ctx: RequestCtx = requestCtx(c)   // narrows
 *     const ctx = requestCtx(c)               // does NOT narrow
 *
 * TypeScript applies never-return narrowing only when every name in the call target is explicitly
 * typed, and an inferred `const` is not. The inferred spelling still throws at runtime, so nothing
 * misbehaves — the compiler simply goes on believing the row may be undefined, and the resulting
 * error surfaces in whatever file next touches it rather than here.

 * Reading and writing who may see one of a plugin's own rows (D29, D31).

 * A plugin DECLARES a restrictable resource through `ServerPlugin.visibilityResources`, and the
 * kit reads that declaration for the predicate and for the 409 `group_in_use` count. These three
 * are the other half — what the kit's own routes do around that declaration, and what a plugin
 * had to reimplement without them. They dispatch through the registry, so they work for the
 * plugin's own `key` exactly as they do for `document`.
 *
 * **They are methods rather than importable functions because the module that implements them
 * composes the registry, and composing it means reading the plugin barrel.** A plugin importing
 * that module closes the cycle `plugins/api → access → plugins/server → <plugin>/index →
 * plugins/api`, which with a SECOND plugin installed throws `createRouter is not a function` at
 * import (`services/access-sql.ts` carries the measurement). `accessScopeOf` escaped by moving to
 * a leaf; these cannot, because composition is their entire purpose. So they are injected, which
 * is the kit's own rule for exactly this case.
 *
 * Two behaviours they carry that are easy to lose in a reimplementation, and both are security
 * properties rather than conveniences:
 *
 * - **Every group id is checked against the tenant before it is stored**, so a grant can never

 * - **A member may share only with groups they are in** — 403 `group_not_yours`. Otherwise
 *   "restrict to Finance" is a way to hide a row from yourself, and to discover which groups
 *   exist. An admin-level caller (`scope.bypass`) may use any group in the tenant.
