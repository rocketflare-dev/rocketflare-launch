/**
 * Who is asking, and what they may do (D10, D29, D30, D31).
 *
 * Three different questions live here and the kit keeps them apart on purpose. Conflating any two
 * of them is the bug this file exists to make hard:
 *
 * 1. **May this ROLE do this KIND of thing?** — `guard` / `can`, over CASL. A plugin declares its
 *    subject in `SharedPlugin.subjects` and grants it in `ServerPlugin.grants`.
 * 2. **Is this ROW theirs?** — never CASL. It is the route's own `ownerUserId` check, or a SQL
 *    predicate (`./access.ts`). The kit uses no CASL conditions anywhere.
 * 3. **Does this deployment SHIP this surface?** — a feature flag, and it is configuration rather
 *    than a permission. `hasFeature(...)`, never `can('access', 'Feature:x')`: `globalAdmin` is
 *    `manage all`, which in CASL covers `access` on every `Feature:` subject, so the ability form
 *    answers "on" for platform staff whatever the deployment ships. That disagreement — an ability
 *    saying yes while the array said no — is a real incident, recorded in `docs/CONCEPTS.md` §15.
