/**
 * A nudge from somewhere with no `waitUntil` — a queue handler, a cron task, a Workflow step.
 *
 * `services/realtime.ts` sends through a `Realtime`'s `defer`, which is `waitUntil` on the request
 * path. A background context has no such thing: the invocation ends when the handler returns, so
 * anything handed to a `defer` that resolves to "await it inline" must actually BE awaited, and
 * anything handed to one that drops it is lost.
 *
 * So this builds a `Realtime` whose `defer` collects, and awaits the collection. That keeps
 * `services/realtime.ts` the only module that touches `NOTIFICATIONS_HUB` — the kit's own runtime
 * does the same thing for Workflow steps (`createStepRealtime`), and this is the plugin-facing
 * spelling of it, kept here rather than imported because the runtime's version lives inside the
 * deletable `feature-agents` surface.
