/**
 * `WorkflowCtx` (D7, D31) — a plugin's half of a durable multi-step run.
 *
 * **Unexercised.** Neither plugin that existed when this was written registers a workflow step, so
 * everything here is derived from the kit's OWN `AgentRunWorkflow` (`api/workflows/agent-run.ts`)
 * rather than from a plugin that needed it. It is deliberately minimal: what the kit's own workflow
 * demonstrably needs, and nothing speculative beyond it. Widen it when a second workflow exists to
 * widen it FOR, not before.
 *
 * It exists at all because three of the rules below are things a plugin would otherwise get wrong
 * once, in production, in a way that reads as an application bug:
 *
 * 1. **A duplicate step name within one run throws, here, immediately.** To the platform a step
 *    name IS that step's identity, and a repeated one replays the first call's recorded result
 *    rather than running again. The kit hit this and documented it: reuse `'execute'` across an
 *    approval round and the second attempt silently returns the first one's answer, which reads
 *    exactly like "the agent ignored my approval". Carrying the round in the name (`execute#0`,
 *    `execute#1`) is the fix, and this guard is what makes forgetting it loud.
 * 2. **Each step gets a FRESH database client**, opened when the step body starts and closed when
 *    it ends, whatever happens. A client shared across steps is a client held open across a
 *    checkpoint — and across a park that may be days. `step` therefore HANDS `fn` the handle rather
 *    than letting a plugin capture one.
 * 3. **Everything is awaited.** A step has no `waitUntil`, so nudges are collected and settled
 *    before the step returns.
 *
 * `T extends Rpc.Serializable<T>` is the platform's own constraint, repeated rather than widened:
 * a step's return value is CHECKPOINTED, so it has to survive a round trip. Keep it a small object
 * (`{ id, status }`) — a row with a `Date` on it comes back as a string.
 *
 * `withStepDatabase` is deliberately re-implemented here rather than imported: the kit's copy lives
 * in `api/workflows/agent-run.ts`, which is inside the deletable `feature-agents` surface, and this
 * surface must not disappear with the example agents.
