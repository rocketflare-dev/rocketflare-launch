/**
 * Feature flags (D30) — the stored half. The KEYS live in code (`FEATURE_FLAGS` in
 * `@launch/shared/features`); these two tables hold only what a global admin changes, so
 * adding or retiring a flag is a code edit and never a migration.
 *
 * `feature_flags` is PLATFORM-level and deliberately has no `tenant_id`: it is the rollout state of
 * one flag across every organisation, edited only behind `globalAdminMiddleware`. That is why it
 * appears in `RLS_EXCLUDED_TABLES` rather than carrying a policy.
 *
 * Three decisions worth stating, because each is somewhere a reader will reach for the wrong thing:
 *
 * - **`key` is the primary key, with no surrogate `id`.** The key is the identity in every consumer
 *   — `requireFeature('x')`, the hash input, the override FK, the registry lookup. A uuid beside it
 *   would be a second identity nobody uses. (`group_members` and every fact table set the same
 *   precedent.) The key is therefore immutable: renaming a flag is delete-then-create, because the
 *   string is compiled into the app.
 * - **`state` is kept even though `off` and `rollout` at 0% have the same outcome.** The column is
 *   the decision and the number is only its parameter — collapsing them would mean pausing a
 *   rollout by dialling it to 0 destroys the percentage you had reached.
 * - **`tenant_feature_overrides` has NO composite FK to `tenant_users`.** `group_members` carries
 *   one so losing a membership loses the grants; copying it here would reject every write, because
 *   the person setting an override is a global admin who is almost never a member of the tenant
 *   they are overriding. `set_by_user_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL` for the same reason a fact table
 *   has no FK to `users`: administration must not fail because somebody left.
