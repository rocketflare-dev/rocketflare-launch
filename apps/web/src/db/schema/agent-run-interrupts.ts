/**
 * `agent_run_interrupts` — one row per question an agent run asked a person (issue #17). The run
 * parks (`agent_runs.status = 'awaiting_input'`, the Workflow instance on `step.waitForEvent`) and
 * resumes when somebody answers.
 *
 * Three properties of this table are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **`id` IS the AG-UI `Interrupt.id`.** The row is not a private mirror of something sent on the
 *   wire; it is the thing, and `toAguiInterrupt(row)` is a pure projection of it.
 * - **`UNIQUE (run_id, key)` is the idempotency.** A retried `execute` step re-enters the agent's
 *   `run()` from the top and asks again; the unique index is what makes the second ask find the
 *   first ask's ANSWER rather than opening a second question that nobody will ever see. Like
 *   `agent_run_effects_run_key_idx`, it is a database constraint and never an in-memory map.
 * - **`status` is the decision and every settle is a compare-and-set on `pending`.** That is what
 *   makes "two people answer at once → one 200, one 409" true, and it is why a rejection is
 *   `status = 'cancelled'` rather than an `approved` boolean: two ways to say no is how a UI and a
 *   server end up disagreeing (see `@launch/shared/ai/interrupts`).
 *
 * `runId` is the ONLY host-specific column. Giving chat the same machinery is a nullable
 * `conversationId` sibling plus `CHECK (num_nonnulls(run_id, conversation_id) = 1)` — that is the
 * whole migration, which is why nothing else here names a run.
