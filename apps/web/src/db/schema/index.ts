 * Schema barrel — every table file is re-exported from here so `drizzle.config.ts`,

 * Installed plugin tables (D31). Position in this file decides nothing: a name exported by two
 * `export *` declarations is AMBIGUOUS, and TypeScript reports it (TS2308) instead of silently
 * letting one win — which is the loud failure that wants to happen before `pnpm db:generate`
 * writes DDL for a table that shadows a kit one. Biome sorts these lines, so this one sits where
 * the sorter puts it.
