/**
 * The AG-UI client for a LIVE agent run: GET `/api/agents/runs/:id/agui/stream` and read the run's
 * timeline as it fills (issue #7).
 *
 * A sibling of `aguiStream.ts`, and the differences are the whole design. That one POSTs a user
 * turn and OWNS the run it is streaming — so a body failure there is a `RUN_ERROR` and the run is
 * over. This one GETs a read-only tail of a Workflow executing in another isolate, so it owns
 * nothing: **the stream closing with no terminal event is not an error, it is "reconnect"**
 * (decision 6), uniformly for a redeploy, the server's idle cap, its 10-minute duration cap, a
 * transport error and the caller's own abort. Reconnecting is the HOOK's job — this module is
 * transport, resolves with what it saw, and never retries.
 *
 * `lastSeq` is the cursor: the server writes `agent_run_events.seq` into the SSE `id:` field of the
 * LAST frame of each row's group, so a resume from `lastSeq` replays whole groups and never lands
 * inside one. Hand it back as `?afterSeq=` — explicit, because `Last-Event-ID` is only honoured for
 * the sake of third-party `EventSource` clients and a stale browser value must never win.
 *
 * `@ag-ui/core` reaches the browser only through this module's import of
 * `@launch/shared/ai/agui` — it must stay out of the eager shell (`.claude/rules/ui.md`).
