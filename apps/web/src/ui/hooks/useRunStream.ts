/**
 * Live run progress (issue #7): the run's AG-UI timeline, filling in ~500 ms instead of 3-second
 * poll lumps.
 *
 * **Additive by construction.** The run page is built against the poll path; this hook is the
 * upgrade, and deleting it must leave a working page. That is why it owns one cache entry of its
 * own and nothing else.
 *
 * The cache rule, flatly: **the stream is the only writer of `['agent-run-agui', id]`**, appends
 * to it with `setQueryData`, and never touches the run row. A terminal frame invalidates
 * `queryKeys.agentRuns.all` ONCE so the row and the list catch up. Nothing else — in particular a
 * terminal status is never synthesised client-side, which is how a UI comes to claim success for a
 * run the server later marks failed.
 *
 * The query is the snapshot and the fallback in one: it fetches `GET /runs/:id/agui` on mount (so
 * the page renders the backlog immediately and the stream resumes from its `lastSeq` instead of
 * replaying the whole run), and after {@link RUN_STREAM_FALLBACK_ATTEMPTS} connections that
 * delivered nothing it gains a `RUN_POLL_MS` `refetchInterval` — which is exactly today's
 * behaviour against a different URL.
 *
 * Reconnection lives here rather than in the transport, because "the stream closed with no
 * terminal event" means *reconnect* and only a component knows whether it still wants to be
 * connected. A closed stream is never an error to the user: a redeploy, the server's idle cap, its
 * 10-minute duration cap and a dropped connection are all the same event (decision 6).
