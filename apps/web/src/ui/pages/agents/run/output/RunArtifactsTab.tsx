/**
 * The things this run produced that a person opens.
 *
 * Artifacts come from the TABLE (decision 4) — mutable, queryable across runs, outliving the run —
 * with the event rows supplying only the ORDER they appeared in. `outputFor().artifacts?.(output)`
 * is the zero-server-change fallback — used only when the table has none, so it can never duplicate
 * what an agent recorded for itself — and it is what keeps this tab useful for an agent that never
 * called `ctx.artifact()` (both shipped ones do).
