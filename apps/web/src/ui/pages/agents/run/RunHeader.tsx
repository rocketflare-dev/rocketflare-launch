/**
 * The run's identity line: how long it has been going, whether it is live, and the one destructive
 * control. The status badge is the page header's, beside the title.
 *
 * **Duration is the only figure here.** Requested / Started / Finished were three more rows of
 * chrome above the fold, read once in a hundred visits and never glanced at; they now sit in the
 * Usage tab with everything else the rows know about this run. Elapsed time is the one a person
 * actually watches, so it stays where they are already looking.
 *
 * Cancel stays CLICKABLE once a cancel has been asked for — the second press forces it (the server
 * terminates the Workflow instance and settles the row), so a run whose loop stopped polling can
 * never strand somebody on "Cancelling…" or hold an exclusive agent's only slot forever.
