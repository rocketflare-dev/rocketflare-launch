/**
 * Form registry keyed by `agentKey` (D7, issue #17). **Adding an agent to the kit is one shared
 * input schema + one entry here + one `outputs/` entry** — two registries keyed the same way, which
 * is the right amount of ceremony: one combined map would make the run MODAL's chunk and the run
 * PAGE's chunk pull each other's components.
 *
 * `formFor` is three rungs, in order:
 *
 * 1. a **registered** form — hand-written, with the agent's own copy, counters and affordances;
 * 2. **`schemaForm(inputJsonSchema)`** — built from the agent's own schema, which the server
 *    already converts for the tool loop, so an app's agent gets real fields for free;
 * 3. **`jsonForm`** — a JSON textarea whose only client-side check is "parses". The route validates
 *    with the agent's `inputSchema` and answers 400 with field issues either way.
