/**
 * Output registry keyed by `agentKey` (issue #17), the twin of `forms/`.
 *
 * **An agent in this kit is one shared input schema + one `forms/` entry + one `outputs/` entry.**
 * Before this, the run surface hard-coded `agentKey === 'summarize-text'` and
 * `agentKey === 'research-topic'` inside one component, which is exactly the shape that makes an
 * app's third agent a diff against kit code rather than a new file beside it.
 *
 * An agent with no entry gets the raw JSON view, which is a real answer rather than an apology: the
 * output is a validated object and reading it is sometimes the whole point.
