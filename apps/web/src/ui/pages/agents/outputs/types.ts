/**
 * The per-agent OUTPUT contract, mirroring `forms/` (issue #17). An agent's `output` is validated
 * by the runtime against its own `outputSchema`, so each entry ships the SAME shared schema and
 * parses before rendering — a run written by an older build simply falls through to the raw JSON.
 *
 * `artifacts` is the zero-server-change FALLBACK, used only when the run's table rows are empty:
 * an agent that never called `ctx.artifact()` can still put its result on the Artifacts tab by
 * deriving one from the output it already returns. Both shipped agents DO call `ctx.artifact()`,
 * so for them this covers runs recorded before they did.
