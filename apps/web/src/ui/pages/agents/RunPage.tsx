/**
 * `/agents/runs/:runId` — a run as a PAGE (issue #17), not a modal over a list.
 *
 * A modal is the wrong home for something a person is asked to *act* on, arrives at from a
 * notification, may need to read a document before deciding, and may leave and come back to. So:
 * its own route, its own URL, a breadcrumb, no `role="dialog"`, and nothing that closes on Escape.
 *
 * The layout says what the page is for. The **action panel is above the timeline**, full width and
 * sticky, because somebody arriving from a notification is here to decide, not to read; then the
 * **input**, because "what was it asked?" is the first question anybody has about a run they did
 * not start; below them the timeline and the answer sit side by side. Under `lg` they stack **tabs
 * first, timeline second** — on a phone the answer is what people came for. `run.error` renders
 * above the tab bar, always: **a failure is not a tab.**
 *
 * **The split follows the run's state, until the reader says otherwise** (`runLayout`, pure): while
 * it is working the timeline is the major column and the output pane is an empty state; once it
 * settles the answer is what they came for. An override wins permanently, because a run settling
 * mid-read must not swap the columns under somebody.
 *
 * **Built against the poll path.** `GET /runs/:id` is the whole data source — the row, its durable
 * events, its asks and its artifacts — refreshed by the `agent-run` nudge and polled while the
 * server still owes an answer. `useRunStream` is layered on top purely for CADENCE: when it reports
 * a `seq` the page has not seen, the page re-reads the run, so the timeline fills in ~500 ms
 * instead of 3 s lumps. Delete the hook and the page still works, which is the property phase 6 was
 * built to preserve.
 *
 * Everything the right pane shows that is not `run.output` is a selector over the same rows, never
 * a second fetch.

 * The split control: a handle ON the edge it drags, not a labelled button inside one panel's

 * sitting on the boundary pointing the way the boundary will go says both by position alone.
 *
 * It is still a real `<button>` with a real name — `aria-label` carries the sentence the glyph
 * replaces, because an icon has no accessible name of its own and a screen reader would otherwise
 * read nothing at all. No `aria-pressed`: the name describes the ACTION and changes with the
 * layout, which is a different control from a two-state toggle and must not claim to be one.
 *
 * **It is a CHILD of the timeline panel, and rides that panel's own right edge** (`right-0` +
 * `translate-x-1/2`, `top-1` so it tucks just under the corner). It used to be absolutely
 * positioned over the grid at `left-[60%]`, which is wrong and cannot be made right by tuning the
 * number: with `grid-cols-[3fr_2fr] gap-8` the panel's border sits at `3/5 × (W − gap)`, so the
 * handle floated `0.6 × gap` to the right of it, and every widening of the gutter made it worse.
 * Anchored to the element that OWNS the border, it is correct for any fraction and any gap.
 *
 * Hidden below `lg`, where the columns stack and there is no split to move.

/**
 * The stream as a CADENCE upgrade over the poll, and nothing else.
 *
 * `useRunStream` owns `['agent-run-agui', id]` and never touches the run row — that rule is phase
 * 6's and it stays. Here we read only its cursor: when the server has written a `seq` this page has
 * not rendered, re-read the run. That keeps ONE representation of the log (the durable rows) rather
 * than a second, lossy one reconstructed from AG-UI, and an idle run makes no requests at all where
 * the poll made twenty a minute.
 *
 * The re-read is bursty by nature, which is why the SERVER holds the other half of the bargain:
 * `GET /runs/:id` hands `reconcileRun` the newest event's timestamp, so a run that is actively
 * writing rows costs no Workflow subrequest to re-read. Coalescing here is one fetch in flight at a
 * time and nothing more — a debounce would spend exactly the latency phase 6 was built to buy.
 *
 * Deleting this hook leaves `useAgentRun`'s own `refetchInterval`, which is a working page.
