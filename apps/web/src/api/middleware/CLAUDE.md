# Middleware

Applied globally in `src/api/index.ts` in THIS order (04 §10). Each step needs what the earlier
ones set; reordering silently breaks something.

| # | File | Sets / does | Why here |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | `error-handler.ts` | `app.onError` + `app.notFound` → shared envelope `{ error, statusCode, code?, details? }` | Registered first so even a config failure gets the envelope |
| 2 | `request-logger.ts` | `requestId`, `logger` (hono-pino) | Every later log line, including config errors, has a request id. The one middleware that runs before config, so it calls `loadConfig` itself and falls back to `info` |
| 3 | `config.ts` | `config` = `loadConfig(c.env)` (D3) | Everything below reads `c.get('config')`, never `c.env` |
| 4 | `security-headers.ts` | Headers after `next()`; **a 101 is returned untouched** (the DO's upgrade response has immutable headers; re-wrapping drops the socket) | Early so 4xx/5xx from later middleware are covered too |
| 5 | `body-limit.ts` | `jsonBodyLimit` 1 MB on `/api/*`, `/auth/*` → 413 `payload_too_large`; **skipped for `/api/files`, `/api/ai/documents/upload` and `/api/sessions/:id/attachments`** (`isUploadPath`: `UPLOAD_PATHS`, `UPLOAD_PATH_PATTERNS`) — `routes/files.ts` mounts `uploadBodyLimit` (`MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES + 64 KB` multipart overhead) on its `POST` and enforces the exact per-file cap in the handler | Before any parsing or DB work; the upload cap is per route so one route's multipart need does not lift the JSON cap everywhere |
| 6 | `cors.ts` | Function origin from `config.APP_URL` (+ outside production: the :3000/:3001 dev origins and the loopback twin of `APP_URL` and of the request's own loopback origin, so custom `DEV_UI_PORT`/`DEV_API_PORT` need only `APP_URL` to follow; `csrf.ts` reads the same `allowedOrigins(cfg, c.req.url)`); **bypassed when `Upgrade: websocket`** (`isWebSocketUpgrade`) — CORS does not govern the handshake and `cors()` would try to set headers on the immutable 101 | Must answer preflights BEFORE csrf can reject them |
| 7 | `csrf.ts` | Origin/Referer/Sec-Fetch-Site check for cookie-authed unsafe methods → 403 `csrf_failed` | Cookie-only, no DB: cheap rejection before we open a client |
| 8 | `database.ts` | `db` per request from `openDatabase` (D35 — either driver), closed in `waitUntil`; exports `deferOrAwait(c, fn)` (= `waitUntil`, awaited inline without an ExecutionContext) | Last global: first thing with real cost |
| 9 | `tracing.ts` | `tracerMiddleware` on `/api/*` — `tracer` = `tracerFor(config, { store: ownConnectionSpanStore(config, env) })` (D32): the span recorder with the OTLP exporter when a backend is configured (`exporterSettings`) plus the `ai_spans` store, which opens its OWN short-lived client per non-empty flush because the request's may already be closed; `noopTracer` only when neither sink exists; after `next()` the batch is flushed through `deferOrAwait` (never on the response path). `withAuth` exposes it as `tracer`; a bare router without it falls back to `noopTracer` | Needs `config`; must wrap the handler so a flush follows every traced call. Streaming routes flush again themselves inside the stream — flushing an empty batch is a no-op |
| — | `auth.ts` | `authMiddleware` (cookie `__Host-session` OR `Authorization: Bearer <api key>` → `auth: AuthContext`; ONE LATERAL query; sliding expiry via `waitUntil`) and `globalAdminMiddleware` / `platformAdminMiddleware` (cookie OR an `admin`-scoped API key, + `isGlobalAdmin` / `canAdministerPlatform` re-checked per request; a `tenant` key → 403 `admin_key_required`); `resolveCookieAuth(c)` is the exported cookie half that `routes/ws.ts` calls itself | Applied PER MOUNT in `index.ts`, never inside route files: the public surface (health, `/auth/*`, `/api/invite/:token`, `/ws` — which cannot carry headers and so authenticates inline) is enumerable and small |
| — | `feature.ts` | `requireFeature(name)` → a middleware for the optional THIRD element of a mount-table entry in `index.ts`; 404 `feature_disabled` (not 403 — that would confirm the feature exists) when `auth.features` lacks it. Reads the ARRAY, never the ability: `manage all` covers every `Feature:` subject | After `authMiddleware` on the same prefix, because it reads what that sets |
| — | `permissions.ts` | `guardPermission` / `can` / `guardOwner` / `isAdminLevel` over `auth.ability` | Called inside handlers after `withAuthAndDb(c)` |
| — | `rate-limit.ts` | `authRateLimit` (KV sliding window, 10/min/IP, no-op without `RATE_LIMIT_KV`), `operationLock(kv, key, fn)` per-tenant mutex | Mounted on login-shaped routes in `routes/auth/index.ts` and on invite accept in `index.ts` |

Auth codes (envelopes): 401 `unauthorized` · 403 `blocked` · 403 `tenant_suspended` (middleware) · 403 `no_tenant` / `pending_approval` (thrown by `withAuthAndDb` when a valid session has no membership, so tenant-free routes using `withAuth` keep working) · 404 `tenancy_mode_single` (`requireMultiTenant`). AI (thrown by services, not middleware): 503 `ai_not_configured` (`AiNotConfiguredError`, `services/ai/errors.ts`) · 503 `agent_runs_not_configured` · 409 `agent_run_active` · 409 `interrupt_not_pending` (somebody else answered first — the compare-and-set lost, and the UI renders it as that rather than as an error) · 409 `run_not_awaiting_input`.
`rate-limit.ts` also exports the generic `rateLimit({ name, max, windowSeconds })`; `routes/ai-config.ts` mounts it (`ai-test`, 10/min/IP) on `POST /api/ai/config/test` because every call spends provider money.

Constraints:
- Nothing in `src/` reads `process.env` or imports `node:*`. Bindings live on `c.env`; config on `c.get('config')`.
- Errors are THROWN (`utils/core/errors.ts`), never hand-rolled `c.json({ error })`; `error-handler.ts` is the single place they become responses.
- Anything trusting `c.get('auth').tenantId` is safe; anything reading tenant ids from the request body/query is not.

## Adding one

1. `export const xMiddleware = createMiddleware<AppEnv>(async (c, next) => { ... })` — typed via `AppEnv`, never a bare `Context`.
2. Add a `Variables` field to `src/api/types.ts` if it sets context.
3. Insert it in `src/api/index.ts` at the step whose inputs it needs, update the table above, and add a test in `tests/api/`.
