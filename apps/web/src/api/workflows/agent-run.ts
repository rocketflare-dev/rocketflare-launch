/**
 * `AgentRunWorkflow` (D5, D7) — the ONE Workflow class, bound as `AGENT_RUN_WORKFLOW`; the agent
 * runtime IS the example workflow. The instance id starts as the run id (`enqueueRun` creates it
 * after the `agent_runs` row exists) and becomes `<runId>-r1`, `-r2`… if a park has to be restarted
 * on a lost instance (`nudgeOrRestartInstance`, T5). The steps — Workflows checkpoint between them:
 *   claim       → `claimRun` (row is the gate; a cancelled-while-queued run exits here)
 *   execute#N   → the whole tool loop INSIDE one step (`retries: 2`, `timeout: 10 minutes`); the
 *                 runtime rethrows only faults a retry can fix, and the retry re-claims through the
 *                 same row. `awaiting_input` back means a person now owes the run an answer
 *   resume#N    → `step.waitForEvent(AGENT_RESUME_EVENT)` — the durable park (issue #17). The
 *                 resolve route flips the row `awaiting_input → running` and THEN wakes us, so the
 *                 next `execute#N+1` re-enters `run()` from the top and finds the answer as a row
 *   expire#N    → nobody answered inside `AGENT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT`: settle `cancelled`, `error` NULL
 *   finish      → backstop settle + final nudge
 * **Every step name carries its round.** A step name is its identity to the platform: a fixed
 * `'execute'` called twice replays the first call's result, and the bug reads as "the agent ignored
 * my approval". `MAX_INTERRUPT_ROUNDS` bounds the loop — a correctness guard, not a capacity one
 * (the step budget is 10,000; 32 rounds is two steps each).
 * The loop body is un-step-shaped on purpose, and that is now a settled decision rather than a gap:
 * one `step.do` per model turn was investigated and rejected (`docs/CONCEPTS.md` §9 Known gaps has
 * the evidence). Short version — steps do not nest, so per-turn steps need `run()` to move outside
 * `step.do`, and Workflows replays everything outside a step, which would double the
 * `agent_run_events` timeline unless every emit and tool call got its own step. Meanwhile wall clock
 * per step is UNLIMITED (the 10 minutes below is our policy, raise it if a run needs longer), CPU
 * per step excludes I/O and goes to 300 s via `[limits] cpu_ms`, and resuming a retry at turn N is
 * what `agent_runs.checkpoint` already does.
 * Each step opens its OWN DB client (`openDatabase`, either driver — D35) and closes it in
 * `finally`; Hyperdrive or Neon is the pool.
 * Exported from `src/worker.ts`, never from `api/index.ts`.
