/**
 * `chat.compact` (D17) — fold the messages that no longer fit a conversation's context budget into
 * its rolling summary, so a long thread forgets gracefully instead of either overflowing the model
 * or silently losing its beginning.
 *
 * It is a JOB, not part of the turn, for one reason: a chat reply is the latency a person feels,
 * and compaction is a whole extra model call. The cost of that choice is honest and bounded — the
 * turn that FIRST crosses the budget answers without a summary, and says so with
 * `CUSTOM kit.notice { history_truncated }`. Every turn after it has one.
 *
 * The message carries ids only, so the handler recomputes the window from the database with the
 * same pure `selectHistoryWindow` the route used. That matters: by the time this runs, the turn
 * that enqueued it has usually persisted its answer, and summarising the window as it is NOW is
 * more correct than summarising the window as it was.
 *
 * Concurrency is a compare-and-set, not a lock: the write only lands while
 * `summarised_through_id` is still what this run read. Two overlapping jobs therefore produce one
 * summary and one no-op rather than a lost update, and the loser costs tokens, not correctness.
