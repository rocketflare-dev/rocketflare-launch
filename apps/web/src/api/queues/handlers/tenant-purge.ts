/**
 * `tenant.purge` (D7): delete what a deleted tenant left OUTSIDE Postgres.
 *
 * Inside Postgres the FK cascade from `tenantRef()` is the whole cleanup, and it is complete. It
 * reaches nothing else, though — R2 objects under `tenants/<tenantId>/` sat there for the life of
 * the bucket — so this job is the other half, and it is a QUEUE message rather than best-effort
 * work in the delete route for the same reason `agent_run_effects` exists: a durable record with
 * at-least-once delivery beats a `waitUntil` that an isolate can drop on the floor.
 *
 * The tenant row is gone before the first delivery, so everything the purge needs is in the
 * payload; there is nothing left to look up.
 *
 * **Idempotent**: a second delivery lists an empty prefix and deletes nothing, and every plugin
 * hook promises the same, so a retry is free and a half-finished run resumes rather than restarts.
