/**
 * Resource visibility (D29) — the ONE place "who may read this row" is expressed as SQL.
 *
 * The kit never uses CASL conditions: an ability answers "may this role do this KIND of thing",
 * and "is this particular row yours" is always a predicate in the query. Groups follow that rule
 * exactly — `visibleDocuments(scope)` returns a `SQL` fragment that is **ANDed with the tenant
 * predicate and never replaces it**, and an installed plugin contributes its own the same way
 * through `ServerPlugin.visibilityResources` (D31; the analytics plugin's dashboards are one).
 *
 * The predicate reads: the resource is tenant-wide, OR the reader owns it, OR the reader is in one
 * of the groups it was shared with. `bypass` (admin, owner, support, global admin) drops the
 * predicate entirely — support included, deliberately: it is `isAdminLevel` everywhere else and it
 * is a visible membership row the customer can see.
 *
 * The one asymmetry worth naming: an EMPTY grant list under `visibility: 'groups'` matches nobody,
 * so a resource whose last group was deleted becomes owner-and-admins-only rather than public.
