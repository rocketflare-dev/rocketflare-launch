/**
 * The agent registry (D7, D17): `AGENTS` maps every `AgentKey` to a definition = the shared
 * `AgentMeta` (key, title, schemas, promptKey, exclusive) + a server-side `run(ctx)`. The runtime
 * (`runtime.ts`, driven by `workflows/agent-run.ts`) owns the lifecycle — claim, trace, client,
 * cancellation, persistence, events — so an agent is a declarative meta and one async function that
 * reads `ctx.input`, calls the model through `ctx.chat` (with `ctx.tools` — the knowledge base is
 * available to every agent through `search_knowledge`), emits progress and returns its output.
 * Adding an agent = a key in `@launch/shared/ai/agents`, a prompt in `services/prompts.ts`, a file in
 * `examples/` and one entry here. No migration.
