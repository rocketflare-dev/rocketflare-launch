/**
 * `search_knowledge` (D7, D18) — every agent's read access to the tenant's knowledge base: the same
 * hybrid `searchChunks` the `/search` page uses, bound to the run's `AccessScope` — the run's
 * tenant AND the requesting person's group visibility, never a model-supplied one. A document the
 * requester may not read is not in the corpus this tool searches (D29).
 *
 * The shape of the answer is the whole design here — a model can only reason about what the tool
 * hands back, so:
 *
 * - **Passages come back whole** (up to `PASSAGE_MAX_CHARS`, above the ~3 200-char chunk size)
 *   inside a total `RESPONSE_MAX_CHARS` budget. Truncating every hit to a snippet was the old
 *   behaviour and it starved the model: it saw a third of each passage and had no way to know.
 *   Anything the budget drops is REPORTED (`omitted`), never silently cut.
 * - **Hits are grouped by document and say where in it they sit**: `documentId` and title on the
 *   group, and per passage `passage` (n of `documentPassages`) plus `charOffset` — the exact
 *   `get_document` offset to read around the match. "Read more of this one" is then a mechanical
 *   next call, not a guess, and the model can attribute a claim to a place, not just a file.
 * - **The ranking is nearest-neighbour, not a relevance threshold.** Dense search always returns
 *   the closest passages, so an off-topic query gets the least-unrelated ones rather than nothing.
 *   Every non-empty answer therefore carries `note`, telling the model to judge the text and
 *   discard passages that do not answer the question — the alternative, an arbitrary score cut-off
 *   over an uncalibrated RRF score, would hide good hits as readily as bad ones.
 * - **An empty result is still information**: the answer carries the documents that DO exist
 *   (`knowledgeBase`), so the model re-queries with the right vocabulary instead of concluding the
 *   knowledge base is empty. `list_documents` (`list-documents.ts`) is the same view on demand.
 *
 * `get_document` (`get-document.ts`) reads what search found; `buildAgentTools` in `index.ts` is
 * what the runtime puts on `ctx.tools`.
