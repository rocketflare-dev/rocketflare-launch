/**
 * `research-topic` — the kit's second example agent (D7, D17, D18), and the one that shows the
 * agentic shape: `runToolLoop` over the built-in knowledge tools (`ctx.tools` — `search_knowledge`,
 * `get_document`) until the model calls the terminal `submit_answer`. Where `summarize-text` is one
 * forced tool call, this one lets the model decide how many searches it needs, capped by
 * `AGENT_MAX_TURNS`. Copy it to start an agent that has to look things up.
 *
 * Two decisions worth knowing before you edit it:
 *
 * - **A loop that ends without the terminal tool is salvaged, not failed.** The zero-key floor is
 *   Workers AI, which has no `tool_choice` (a model that answers in prose is a live failure mode,
 *   not an edge case), so `no_tool_call` / `max_turns` falls back to ONE `callStructuredTool` over
 *   the transcript — the same forced-tool + prose-JSON recovery the rest of the kit uses. Only if
 *   that also fails does the run fail, carrying the model's own words in the error details.
 * - **Citations are filtered to what search actually returned.** Every `documentId` the tools
 *   reported is recorded during the loop; a citation naming anything else is dropped rather than
 *   persisted, so a hallucinated id can never reach the UI. The title comes from the search hit,
 *   not from the model.
 *
 * It is also the kit's full human-in-the-loop example (issue #17). Where `summarize-text` asks
 * about a write IT decided to do, this one shows the three shapes a loop-driven agent needs:
 *
 * - **`index_finding` is gated by `Tool.requiresApproval`** — the MODEL decides to call it, so the
 *   gate belongs on the tool, not in the agent. `runToolLoop` scans the whole turn after the
 *   assistant message is pushed and **before any handler runs**, checkpoints and parks. Passing
 *   `approvals: ctx.approvals` and `runApproved: ctx.once` is not optional: without the first the
 *   answered gate is asked again, without the second an approved write repeats on a step retry.
 * - **`ask_human` raises a `choice` interrupt from INSIDE its handler** — the natural place to ask
 *   "which of these did you mean?". `runHandler` rethrows `InterruptRequested` and only that, so
 *   the ask parks the run instead of becoming an `isError` result the model would simply retry.
 * - **`beforeTurn` folds in steering notes** — what a person typed into the run page while it was
 *   still working, delivered exactly once by `ctx.steering()` and appended through
 *   `appendUserText` so a resumed transcript never gains two consecutive user turns.
 *
 * Finally it records what it produced: a `markdown` artifact for the answer and a `table` artifact
 * for the sources, so the run page has something to open rather than only prose to read.
