/**
 * An agent run, read back as AG-UI. A **projection, not a rewrite**: `agent_run_events` stays
 * exactly as it is — the durable record, written inside Workflow steps where every write is
 * awaited and ordered by `seq` — and this maps it at read time. Nothing in the runtime knows AG-UI
 * exists.
 *
 * `threadId` is the run id: an agent run is not a conversation, so it is its own thread of one run.
 *
 * Three deliberate choices:
 *
 * - **A settled `cancelled` run projects as `RUN_ERROR` with code `agent_run_cancelled`.** The
 *   streaming convention — "closed with no terminal event means cancelled" — cannot apply to a
 *   finite array, where the absence of a terminal event is how an ACTIVE run is represented.
 * - **No `kit.usage`.** `ai_usage` rows are not attributable to a run (there is no run column), so
 *   a projection over `(run, events)` has no honest number to report. The Usage page is the ledger.
 * - **An errored tool result keeps its JSON.** `ToolCallResultEvent` has no error flag in
 *   `@ag-ui/core@0.0.59`; add `kit.tool.error` to the CUSTOM union only if a screen needs the red
 *   state.
