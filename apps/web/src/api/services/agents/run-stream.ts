/**
 * `GET /api/agents/runs/:id/agui/stream` — a run's timeline, live (issue #7).
 *
 * A **polling** stream: the body tails `agent_run_events` on one open connection, projects each
 * new row through {@link createRunProjector} and frames it as spec AG-UI with `seq` as the cursor.
 * Measured against what it replaces — every 3 s, `getRun` + `reconcileRun` (a Workflow
 * `instance.status()` subrequest) + `listEvents` returning *every row, unbounded* — it is cheaper
 * per unit of wall clock at six times the resolution: one bounded, indexed
 * `WHERE (tenant_id, run_id) AND seq > $cursor LIMIT 200` that usually returns nothing, plus the
 * run row, on a connection already open.
 *
 * Four rules, each of which is a bug if broken:
 *
 * 1. **`id:` goes on the LAST frame of a row's group, and on no other frame in it.** One row is
 *    not one AG-UI event — a `text` row is `START → CONTENT → END`. Put the id on the first frame
 *    and a drop mid-group leaves the browser's `Last-Event-ID` already past the row, so the resume
 *    starts after it and the client holds a text message that never closes, forever, with no
 *    error. Replaying a whole group is free: every id in it is derived from the row id, so a
 *    replayed group is byte-identical.
 * 2. **No `RUN_ERROR` for the stream's own failure** (decision 6). `chat-turn.ts` emits one
 *    because there the stream *is* the run; here the run is a durable Workflow in another isolate
 *    and is almost certainly fine. Closing with no terminal event means "reconnect", uniformly —
 *    for a redeploy, an idle cap, a duration cap, a transport error and a client abort.
 * 3. **`reconcileRun` runs exactly once, at open, never in the loop.** It is a Workflow subrequest
 *    per call; a 10-minute stream would spend ~1 200 of them on a question the tail already
 *    answers. The route does it before the first frame; this file never touches the binding.
 * 4. **Protobuf has no cursor and no comments.** The AG-UI binary transport has no SSE framing, so
 *    a protobuf client resumes by `?afterSeq=` only — and a `: ping` comment frame written into a
 *    binary stream is not a valid protobuf frame and poisons everything after it.
 *
 * A **parked** run needs no code here: `finish` already returns
 * `RUN_FINISHED { outcome: { type: 'interrupt' } }` for `awaiting_input`, so the generic terminal
 * branch fires and the connection closes. A run parked for seven days therefore holds no
 * connection, no query and no invocation, and the page re-opens on the existing nudge when the
 * answer lands.
