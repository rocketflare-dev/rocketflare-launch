/**
 * How much of a thread a turn replays, and what happens to the rest (D17).
 *
 * A chat turn cannot resend the whole conversation forever, and a message COUNT is the wrong
 * control: what overflows is the model's context window, which is characters. At the per-message
 * cap (`MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`, 32 000) forty stored messages is 1.28M characters — more than any
 * model the kit supports — so a count-only limit produces a thread that fails on every turn with
 * no way out but starting again. The budget here is `CHAT_HISTORY_MAX_CHARS` (a `[vars]` knob,
 * because the right value tracks the model the tenant chose), with the count kept as a backstop.
 *
 * What falls outside the window is **not** silently forgotten: it is folded into
 * `conversations.summary` by the `chat.compact` job and prepended to later turns as the system
 * prompt's `volatile` half — which is also exactly where prompt caching wants it, since the
 * cacheable prefix is `stable` and the summary changes underneath it.
 *
 * Everything here is pure, so the route and the compaction job agree on the window by construction
 * rather than by two implementations that drift.
