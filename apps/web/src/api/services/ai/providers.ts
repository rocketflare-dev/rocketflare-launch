/**

 *
 * **One list, three jobs**: the models the settings picker offers for a Workers AI chat config, the
 * models `client.ts` may send a real `tool_choice` to (`workersAiSupportsToolChoice`), and the
 * models it may stream tools to (`workersAiStreamsTools`). They are the same set deliberately — a
 * model without `tool_choice` falls back to asking in the prompt and unwrapping prose JSON, which
 * is a failure mode rather than a choice worth offering. Separate lists would be separate things to
 * keep in step, and the day they disagreed the picker would recommend a model the runtime cannot
 * constrain.
 *
 * A model absent from it is still usable: a stored config naming one works, stays editable and
 * stays priced. The picker is an affordance, never a validation rule.
 *
 * Hand-kept, because nothing here may depend on a network call. To re-derive: take
 * `wrangler ai models list --json` filtered on the `function_calling` property, keep those whose
 * `wrangler ai models schema <model>` declares `tool_choice` under `input.oneOf[].properties`,
 * drive each through a two-turn tool loop to confirm it streams (nothing documents the stream
 * shape), and price it in `@launch/shared/ai/pricing` from the catalog's own `price` property
 * — an unpriced model shows on the Usage page as an `unpricedCall`.
