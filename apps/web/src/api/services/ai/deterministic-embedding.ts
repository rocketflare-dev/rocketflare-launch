/**
 * Deterministic stand-in embedding — for the demo seed (`pnpm seed --demo`) and the test `RecordingAi`
 * stub ONLY. Nothing on the request path imports this file, so the Worker bundle never includes it;
 * keep it that way (`grep -rn deterministic-embedding apps/web/src` must list only this file).
 *
 * Why it exists: `scripts/seed.ts` runs under `tsx` with no embeddings provider, and the test stub
 * must answer vectors without a platform. Both need the SAME properties from a fake vector:
 *
 * - pure and synchronous — the same text always yields the same vector, under tsx and vitest alike;
 * - `EMBEDDING_DIM` wide and L2-normalised, so it fits `chunks.embedding vector(1024)` and cosine
 *   distance (`<=>`) is well defined;
 * - NEVER the zero vector — `<=>` on a zero vector is NaN and poisons every ranking it touches.
 *
 * The shape is a hashed bag of words (each lower-cased alphanumeric token hashed to a bucket and a
 * sign): passages sharing words with a query rank closest — but ONLY when the query is embedded
 * the same way, which is the case in tests. Under `wrangler dev` a search query is embedded by the
 * real provider (`@cf/baai/bge-m3`), so against seeded chunks the dense half of the hybrid search is
 * noise and the lexical half (`websearch_to_tsquery`) is what finds them. It is not a semantic
 * embedding and must never be mixed with real ones — a seeded document records
 * `embeddingModel: 'seed:deterministic'` for that reason.
