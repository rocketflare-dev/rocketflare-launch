// handler. The kit ships no gated mount; an app adds `['/api/thing', thingRouter, requireFeature('thing')]`.
// Remember the other doors too: a surface with no nav entry (an analytics cube, a dashboard
// template, a CLI command) leaks independently of this one.
// D34: a plugin's PUBLIC mounts — consent callbacks and webhooks a third party calls with no
// session. Only under `/api/hooks/<plugin id>` (the config test refuses anything else, and refuses
// an authed mount there), so this line is the whole of the plugin-owned unauthenticated surface.
// Before the authed table, which never claims `/api/hooks`, so order is belt and braces.
