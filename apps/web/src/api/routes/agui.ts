/**
 * `POST /api/agui/run` — the AG-UI `RunAgentInput` endpoint, so a client that speaks the protocol
 * can drive this app without knowing anything about `/api/chat`. It is a thin wrapper: it
 * reconciles the input against the stored conversation, then calls the SAME `streamChatTurn` the
 * chat route calls. There is exactly one implementation of the event sequence.
 *
 * **Auth is the kit's, unchanged.** `authMiddleware` takes a session cookie or a tenant API key as
 * Bearer, and `csrf.ts` already exempts Bearer requests; a cross-origin browser client needs its
 * origin in the CORS allow-list, which is configuration, not code. **Conversation ownership is the
 * `userId` filter**, so every thread an API key touches belongs to the user who created that key —
 * a key is not a shared mailbox.
 *
 * ## The reconciliation rule: the server is the transcript, the client supplies only the tail
 *
 * 1. `threadId` is a conversation id. Unknown → it is **adopted**: a conversation is created with
 *    that id, after the client resolves, so a 503 lands before any row exists. That is what lets a
 *    stateless client invent a `threadId` and have it work. An id that exists but is not this
 *    user's collides on the primary key → 404 `agui_thread_not_found`.
 * 2. The LAST message is the new user turn; **every earlier message is ignored**. The history the
 *    model sees comes from the database, exactly as it does for `/api/chat`.
 * 3. A last message whose UUID `id` already exists in this conversation is not re-inserted: the run
 *    replays against the existing row, so a client retry is safe (no transaction spans a stream).
 * 4. `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` goes out right after `RUN_STARTED`, carrying the server's transcript. That
 *    is the honest answer to divergence — the client is told in-band what the server believes.
 *
 * Known limits, written down rather than half-fixed: a client that edits or branches history gets
 * the server's history (branching needs a real thread model and is out of scope); two concurrent
 * runs on one `threadId` interleave (the fix is an `agent_runs`-style claim row, never a `Map`);
 * the client's `runId` is echoed but neither stored nor deduplicated on; adopting a thread lets
 * someone create an empty conversation in their OWN tenant, which is harmless.
 *
 * **Inbound `tools[]` is refused** with 400 `agui_client_tools_unsupported` rather than ignored: a
 * client waiting for a call that can never come is worse than an error. Frontend tools need the
 * loop to suspend mid-turn and resume on a later `RunAgentInput`, and `runStreamingChat` has no
 * durable suspend point. The agent runtime already has that machinery (`agent_runs.checkpoint`), so
 * the shape of v2 is "reuse the checkpoint column on `conversations`". Inbound `state` is ignored;
 * outbound state is one read-only `STATE_SNAPSHOT`, never a `STATE_DELTA`.
