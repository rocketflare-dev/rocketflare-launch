/**
 * The role → ability matrix (D10, 02 §10b) as CASL rules. Pure: no logger, no DB, no Hono — the
 * same function runs in the auth middleware (server) and, via `packRules`/`unpackRules`, in the
 * UI's `AbilityProvider`. Owner-ONLY actions (delete tenant, transfer ownership) are NOT here:
 * routes check `role === 'owner'` explicitly (`isOwnerLevel`), because `manage Tenant` is also
 * granted to `support` and to global admins.
 *
 * Skeleton from the Node reference app; typed `AppAbility`, the `access` feature hook with injected
 * `features` from the Workers reference app (its subscription-tier switch is deliberately not ported).
