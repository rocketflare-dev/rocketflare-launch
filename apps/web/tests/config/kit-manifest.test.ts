/**
 * `.rocketflare.json` is what lets a copy of the kit absorb later kit releases: it records where
 * the copy came from, and it classifies every file the kit ships. `scripts/upgrade.mjs` uses that
 * classification to decide, per file, whether a kit change may be applied — and the one outcome
 * that breaks somebody's app is recreating a surface they deleted.
 *
 * So the manifest has to stay true as the kit grows. The coverage assertion below is the check
 * that does it: every tracked file must be claimed by a surface, the never-port list, the manual
 * list or a core prefix. Add a directory the manifest has never heard of and this test fails until
 * somebody says what it is. Same spirit as `rls-coverage.test.ts` and `cube-isolation.test.ts`.
 *
 * The `config` project: no database, no filesystem beyond `git ls-files`.
