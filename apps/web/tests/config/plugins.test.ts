/**
 * The "well-formed plugin" suite (D31, decisions 8 and 9).
 *
 * The division of labour: **a plugin tests its behaviour; the host tests that it is a well-formed
 * plugin.** A plugin's own tests live inside its directory and run in this same suite once it is
 * installed. What this file checks is the handful of properties the HOST depends on and which no
 * plugin author can verify for the combination of plugins a particular app has installed:
 *
 *   - ids are namespaces, so two plugins cannot collide and the kit is never one of them;
 *   - query-key roots carry the plugin's id, so one plugin's invalidation cannot wipe another's;
 *   - nothing reaches INTO a plugin except through its published entries, so a plugin's semver
 *     means something;
 *   - a plugin's `ui.ts` imports nothing heavy and reaches its pages only through `lazy()`, so
 *     installing a plugin cannot quietly move its pages into the main bundle;
 *   - the closed sets a plugin opens are still OPEN at the type level (the `expectTypeOf` block at
 *     the end), which is the one property no runtime assertion can reach.
 *
 * Every check is a pure function over strings, exercised here with fixtures AND run over whatever
 * is installed. With no plugins installed the second half is vacuous — which is why the fixtures
 * are not optional: they are what keeps this suite meaningful in the kit itself.
