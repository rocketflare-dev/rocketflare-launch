/**
 * WHICH repository a release is cut in — the decision `scripts/release-check.mjs` and
 * `scripts/release.mjs` both open with.
 *
 * It used to be a constant, `path.resolve(dirname(import.meta.url), '..')`, so the root was
 * wherever the SCRIPT lived. A shim that cloned the kit and ran `node .kit/scripts/release.mjs`
 * would therefore stamp the KIT's `package.json` rather than its own, which is why the first-party
 * plugins repository carries a verbatim copy of both scripts and six `scripts/lib/*.mjs` files —
 * thousands of lines of duplicate, already drifting, because one path was computed instead of
 * asked for.
 *
 * The three steps below are that fix, and they are asserted as a pure function rather than through
 * a spawned process: `toplevel` is injected, so none of this touches git or the filesystem.
 * The `config` project: no database.
