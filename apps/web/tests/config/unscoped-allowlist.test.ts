/**
 * The cross-tenant allow-list (D1). The invariant in `.claude/rules/database.md`: every domain query
 * filters by `tenantId` from the auth context. This test pins the exceptions, so a new one is a
 * deliberate edit here rather than something that arrives with a feature.
 *
 * What it proves, exactly: no source file queries a table that HAS a `tenant_id` column from inside
 * a function that never mentions a tenant at all. That is narrower than "only these files are
 * cross-tenant" — `routes/admin.ts` does not appear below because its queries DO name a tenant, the
 * one from the URL rather than the session; `globalAdminMiddleware` is what makes that safe, and no
 * static check replaces reading it.
 *
 * How it reads the source: every table with a `tenant_id` column is found from the drizzle schema
 * itself (no hand-kept list), then each `.ts` under `src/` is parsed and every drizzle query naming
 * one of those tables — `.from(t)`, `.insert(t)`, `.update(t)`, `.delete(t)`, `db.query.t.…` — is
 * checked for a tenant predicate anywhere in its enclosing statement.
 *
 * Its limit, stated plainly because the docs once claimed a coverage this file did not have: the
 * unit is the enclosing FUNCTION, so a handler that mentions the tenant in one query and forgets it
 * in a second reads as scoped. It catches the realistic mistake — a route that queries a tenant
 * table and never mentions the tenant at all — not a determined author. `rls-coverage.test.ts` is
 * the other half: every tenant table carries a policy, for the day RLS is enforced.
