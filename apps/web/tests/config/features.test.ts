/**
 * A flag this suite REGISTERS itself, rather than one it borrows (D31).
 *
 * The kit ships no feature of its own any more — its demonstration flag is the `example-feature`
 * plugin — so a suite keyed on a literal would test nothing in a bare kit and would break outright
 * in an app that removed the plugin. What is under test here is the pure evaluation order, which
 * has nothing to do with which flags exist, so the fixture is registered in `beforeAll` and removed
 * in `afterAll`. The `config` project runs each file in its own process, so nothing leaks.
 *
 * The golden vectors below deliberately keep their LITERAL key strings: `featureBucket` takes any
 * string, and those numbers are a wire format — re-keying them would reshuffle every live rollout
 * as surely as changing the hash would.
