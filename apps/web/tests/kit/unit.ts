/**
 * `@testkit/unit` — builders for the plugin context family (D31).
 *
 * Every execution context a plugin is handed (`RequestCtx`, `JobCtx`, `CronCtx`, `WorkflowCtx`,
 * `ToolCtx`) is built here from plain options, so a test can exercise a handler's BRANCHING without
 * standing up a request: the feature gate, the ownership check, the 404 versus the 403, the shape of
 * what comes back.
 *
 * **Every builder requires a `db` the integration harness handed out, and that is the load-bearing
 * rule of this file.** See `./real-db.ts` for why: injection is exactly what makes it easy to write
 * a test that looks like an isolation proof and proves nothing, because a stub returning `[]`
 * satisfies "tenant B sees no rows" whatever the query actually said. So a fake context may test
 * branching, guards and response shape; **anything that touches data is on real Postgres by
 * construction.**
 *
 * The accepted cost, stated rather than discovered later: **there is no fast, database-free test of
 * a data-touching handler.** A slower suite is the price of an isolation case that cannot be faked
 * into passing, and a plugin's isolation case is the one thing the kit treats as non-negotiable —
 * it drives the real mount through `request(...)` from `@testkit/integration` as a second tenant.
 *
 * These are the kit's own adapters (`requestCtx`, `jobCtx`, `cronCtx`, `workflowCtx`, `toolCtx`)
 * wherever one can be reached without a Hono context, so a builder cannot drift from the thing it
 * builds. `makeRequestCtx` is the exception and says so on itself.
