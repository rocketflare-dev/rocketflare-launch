# SETUP — step-by-step walkthrough

Everything needed to take Launch from a fresh clone to a configured, deployed app. Work through
the parts in order; **every step ends with a verification line — do not move on until it passes.**

**This file is instructions, not design.** What the kit does and why is in
[`docs/CONCEPTS.md`](docs/CONCEPTS.md); the Cloudflare topology is in [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md);
code conventions are in `.claude/rules/`.

**Where commands run.** The repo is a pnpm workspace (`apps/web`, `apps/cli`, `packages/shared`).
**Every command below runs from the repository root** unless it says otherwise: the root
`package.json` delegates to the packages (`pnpm dev` → web, `pnpm cli …` → the CLI via `tsx`,
`pnpm web <script>` → any `apps/web` script). `wrangler` and `cfld` are devDependencies of
`apps/web`, so they are run as `pnpm web exec wrangler …` (shorthand for
`pnpm --filter @launch/web exec wrangler …`) — `pnpm exec wrangler` at the root does not exist.

Legend: `[ready]` works out of the box · `[config]` needs your configuration

**Fix missing prerequisites proactively rather than reporting them.** If Node is missing or too
old, install 24 (`nvm install` reads `.nvmrc`, or `fnm use`, or the system package manager). If
pnpm is missing, `corepack enable` (it reads `packageManager` from the root `package.json`). If
Docker is unavailable on macOS, `brew install colima docker && colima start`; on Linux install Docker
Engine and add your user to the `docker` group. Confirm the tool works, then carry on.

---

## Part 1 — First run (local) `[ready]`

> **The short way.** `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh` (or `/launch-setup` in Claude Code; `pnpm bootstrap` once
> Node and pnpm exist) does 1.1–1.7 in one go — ten steps, one `✔ n/10 <name> <what it verified>`
> line each, a `✖` line plus a `fix:` hint on the first failure — and ends with the browser open at
> `http://localhost:3000/login?as=owner@example.test`. macOS or Linux (Windows: WSL2). Re-runnable on
> a half-done machine: it inspects before it acts and never overwrites a value you wrote. Flags:
> `--offline` (no Cloudflare account: comments the `[ai]` block out of both tomls), `--online`
> (restore it), `--no-demo` (plain `pnpm seed`), `--no-plugins` (skip the installed-plugin
> check, §1.4b), `--no-dev` (stop after step 8 and print what to run next), `--no-open`,
> `--as <email>`, `--yes`, `--verbose`, `--db-url <url>` (an existing Postgres instead of Docker,
> §1.4); `--check` is `pnpm preflight`.
> Exit codes: `0` ok · `1` a step failed · `2` usage · `3` prerequisite missing · `4` port/container
> held by another checkout · `5` Cloudflare login required
> (`node scripts/bootstrap.mjs --help`).
> The numbered steps below are what it runs — for doing it by hand, or for debugging one step.

### 1.1 Toolchain
```bash
node -v            # v24.x — from .nvmrc
corepack enable && pnpm -v   # 10.x — from package.json packageManager
docker info >/dev/null && echo docker-ok
```
Verify: three lines — `v24.*`, `10.*`, `docker-ok`. `pnpm preflight` is the same check as one
read-only command (toolchain, `.dev.vars`, Postgres, Cloudflare login, `pnpm dev:status`; exit 3
when anything is missing) — `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh` installs Node through an fnm/nvm that is
already present and pnpm through corepack, and never pipes a URL into a shell.

### 1.2 Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```
Verify: exits 0; `ls apps/web/node_modules/.bin/wrangler` exists and `pnpm web exec wrangler --version`
prints a version. `packages/shared` is linked into both apps as TypeScript source — there is nothing
to build for it. (`ls node_modules/.bin` at the root shows only `biome`, `tsc`, `tsx`: that is
expected.)

### 1.3 Local secrets
```bash
cp apps/web/.dev.vars.example apps/web/.dev.vars
openssl rand -hex 32   # → OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY in apps/web/.dev.vars
```
The only secret `.dev.vars` needs is `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (≥ 32 characters); the bootstrap
generates it (`3/9 secrets`), by hand it is the `openssl` line above.
Verify: `grep -c '^[A-Z_]*=.\+' apps/web/.dev.vars` is at least 2 (`DATABASE_URL` and
`OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` are set). Leave every optional key blank for now — each
feature degrades gracefully (Part 2). `.dev.vars` is git-ignored; never paste other environments'
credentials into it, not even as comments.

### 1.4 Database
```bash
pnpm dev:db:up        # pgvector/pgvector:pg17, first free port from :5432 (apps/web/scripts/dev-db.mjs)
pnpm dev:db:status    # every dev database on this machine, and which one is this checkout's
pnpm web db:check     # apps/web/scripts/test-db-connection.ts
pnpm db:migrate       # db-roles --phase=role → migrations → db-roles --phase=grants
```
Verify: `db:up` prints the port it chose; `db:check` prints the server version; `db:migrate` ends
with the applied migration count and no `role "launch_app" does not exist` error.

**The port is chosen, not fixed.** `dev:db:up` runs `apps/web/scripts/dev-db.mjs`, which gives this
checkout its own compose project, container and port: it keeps the port already in `DATABASE_URL`
whenever that is still free or still this checkout's, and otherwise takes the next free one from
5432 (skipping 5433, the test database) and writes it back to `apps/web/.dev.vars`. So a SECOND
checkout on the same machine starts its own database instead of failing on a taken port or quietly
attaching to the first one's container — and a re-run never moves a database that is working.
Everything downstream reads that one value: `db:migrate`, `seed` and `drizzle-kit` through dotenv,
and `wrangler dev` from `.dev.vars` too (a copy whose toml has a `[[hyperdrive]]` block also gets it
through `CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_HYPERDRIVE`, which `pnpm dev` sets).
`pnpm dev:db:down` stops this checkout's database and never another's.

**The local driver is `postgres`, whatever you deploy.** The tomls' `DATABASE_DRIVER` is the
DEPLOYED driver (`neon` in a fresh copy, D35); `.dev.vars` overrides it locally, and the bootstrap
writes `DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres` there — postgres.js over TCP to the compose database, nothing else
running. To run the deployed Neon driver against the same local database, `pnpm dev:db:up --neon`
also starts a Neon proxy in front of it (per-checkout port from :4444) and writes
`DATABASE_DRIVER=neon` + `NEON_LOCAL_PROXY`; `pnpm dev:db:up --postgres` switches back and stops the
proxy. `pnpm bootstrap --driver neon|postgres` sets the same thing. Verify: `pnpm db:check` prints
`Connected to … (neon driver)` or `(postgres driver)`.

Why three steps: a policy's `TO launch_app` needs the role
before migrations; the `REVOKE`s need the tables after. With `APP_DATABASE_URL` unset the role is
created `NOLOGIN` and RLS stays inert ([`docs/RLS.md`](docs/RLS.md)).

**No Docker: use an existing database.** Where Docker is not available (a coding sandbox with a
Neon branch, a shared dev server), point the bootstrap at the database you already have:
```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --no-dev --db-url "postgresql://user:pass@ep-x.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```
It still runs ten steps. `1/10 toolchain` skips the Docker checks, and `3/10 secrets` writes the URL
to `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/web/.dev.vars` — and, for a `*.neon.tech` URL, `DATABASE_DRIVER=neon`,
which reaches Neon over HTTPS and WebSocket only (what a sandbox with no TCP out allows); any other
URL gets `postgres`, and `--driver` overrides either. `4/10 database` doesn't start a container; it waits for
`db:check` to answer (`external <host>/<db> · Connected to …`). `7/10 seed` runs with
`SEED_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`, because the seed refuses a non-local host otherwise. The seed always prints
`seeding <host>/<db>`, never the credentials. The database needs the pgvector extension available
(Neon has it). Afterwards `pnpm dev` uses that URL unchanged, `pnpm dev:db:up` reports there is
nothing to start, and `pnpm preflight` skips its Docker checks while `DATABASE_URL` points off this
machine. `--db-url` can't be combined with `--check`. A loopback URL (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`)
still counts as this checkout's Docker database to `pnpm preflight` and `dev:db:*`. The URL, password
included, lands in your shell history.

### 1.4b Plugins `[ready]`
```bash
pnpm plugin list                  # what is installed (id, version, repo, when)
pnpm plugin check                 # audit them: exit 1 with one line per failure
```
A **plugin** is a git repository copied into this app — never an npm package — that contributes
contracts, schema, routes, jobs, agents, UI and CLI commands through six barrel files
(`docs/CONCEPTS.md` §16), importing the host only through the declared entries
(`docs/plugin-api.md`) and receiving everything else as injected context. Launch commits its
installed plugins — today `analytics` — with their barrel lines and migrations, and records each in
`launch.plugins.json`. So a fresh clone has nothing to install: the bootstrap's `6/10 plugins` step
only checks every recorded plugin's files are on disk. To add one:

```bash
pnpm plugin add <repo|path>[@ref]          # prints the plan and stops
pnpm plugin add <repo|path>[@ref] --apply  # copies, writes the barrel lines, records the surface
pnpm db:generate --name plugin-<id>-<version> && pnpm db:migrate   # the HOST's migration, always
```

`pnpm bootstrap --no-plugins` skips the check.

Verify: `pnpm plugin list` shows a line per plugin (`analytics  3.4.1 …`), `pnpm plugin check`
prints `✔ n plugin(s) check out` and exits 0, and the bootstrap step reports
`installed: analytics@3.4.1`.

A plugin ships **no migration and no toml edit**: the host runs `pnpm db:generate`, and a binding,
cron or `[vars]` key it declares is written into both tomls by `pnpm provision cloudflare <env>`
(Part 3). `/launch-plugin` drives all of it and always shows the plan before anything is written.

### 1.5 Seed
```bash
pnpm seed             # idempotent: the tenant, owner/admin/member users, one API key
pnpm seed --demo      # the same, plus each installed plugin's demo data (what the bootstrap runs; or SEED_DEMO=1)
```
`pnpm seed` creates the tenant, `owner@` / `admin@` / `member@example.test`, a pending invitation
for `invited@example.test`, the global admin `admin@clewro.com` and one API key. Launch runs
`TENANCY_MODE=single` (`.dev.vars`), so the one tenant is named after `APP_NAME` with slug
`default`; under `multi` it is `Acme` (`acme`). `--demo` additionally runs every installed plugin's
`seedDemo` hook — the analytics plugin seeds its dashboards and rebuilds its fact table. Every demo
row has a fixed id and is inserted `onConflictDoNothing`, so re-running adds nothing. Local
database only — it is a `tsx` script over `DATABASE_URL`.
Verify: the output lists the seeded emails and prints the API key **once** (on the first run only;
later runs say it already exists).
`pnpm db:studio` shows the rows.

### 1.6 Run it
```bash
pnpm dev              # apps/web: wrangler dev :3001 + vite :3000 (strict ports; a preflight
                      # clears this repo's leftovers and names any other port holder)
# pnpm dev:stop       # kill this repo's dev tree (parent first, loops until quiet)
# pnpm dev:status     # what is running here + who holds :3000/:3001
```

> **Ports taken?** (a Cloudflare Sandbox holds :3000, or another app does.) Set `DEV_UI_PORT` and
> `DEV_API_PORT` — in the shell or in `apps/web/.dev.vars` (the shell wins; unset = 3000/3001) —
> and change `APP_URL` in `.dev.vars` to the new UI port, because the Worker builds its OAuth
> redirects, magic links and CORS/CSRF allow-list from it. `DEV_ALLOWED_HOSTS=a.example,b.example`
> lets Vite answer for extra hostnames (a sandbox preview URL). `pnpm dev`, Vite, the bootstrap and
> the seed all read these through `scripts/lib/dev-ports.mjs`; `pnpm dev:api` on its own reads only
> the shell. Substitute your ports for 3000/3001 everywhere below; the CLI's default server stays
> :3001, so pass `--server http://localhost:<DEV_API_PORT>`. `pnpm dev:tunnel` still targets :3000
> (cfld reads `apps/web/package.json`'s `cfld.port`).

> **Cloudflare login and the AI binding.** `wrangler dev` runs everything locally EXCEPT the Workers AI
> binding (`[ai]` in `apps/web/wrangler.toml`), which always calls Cloudflare — so the first `pnpm dev`
> on a machine that has never run `pnpm web exec wrangler login` will ask you to log in (a free account
> is enough). To stay fully offline, comment out the `[ai]` block in BOTH tomls (the parity test keeps
> them in sync): `pnpm bootstrap --offline` does exactly that, and `pnpm bootstrap --online` restores
> it. Chat then needs a key or a tenant provider (§2.5) and embeddings resolve to `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY`
> or report "not configured". After toggling, `pnpm typecheck` regenerates
> `apps/web/worker-configuration.d.ts` without `AI` — restore the block (`--online`) before
> committing so CI's typegen diff stays clean.

Verify: both processes report ready; `curl -s localhost:3001/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok",…}`;
http://localhost:3000 renders the shell. Sign in: enter the seeded owner email, copy the magic-link
URL from the **wrangler dev console** (no `RESEND_API_KEY` → links are logged, not sent), open it,
land on Home. Shortcut (dev only): `http://localhost:3000/login?as=owner@example.test` signs in
through `/auth/dev-login` on load — honoured only when the server reports `devLogin`
(`APP_ENV=development`) and for the four seeded accounts, so an arbitrary address does nothing.

**Analytics check** (still in 1.6 — same terminal pair). Analytics is a PLUGIN from 0.6.0
(`docs/CONCEPTS.md` §8, §16) and the bootstrap's `plugins` step installs it, so this works on a
fresh clone unless you ran `--no-plugins`:
```bash
pnpm cli analytics check-facts       # fact-table freshness; exits 1 when any table is stale
pnpm cli analytics refresh-facts     # enqueue a rebuild for this organisation
```
Verify: `check-facts` prints `analytics_tenant_activity_daily_facts … fresh` and exits 0.
`refresh-facts` returns a job id, and the `wrangler dev` terminal logs the consumer running it
(`wrangler dev` runs the queue consumer in-process). The `15 * * * *` cron is still the normal,
cross-tenant path and `wrangler dev` never fires it by itself, so a laptop database goes stale two
hours after its last rebuild until you run one of the above or
`curl "http://localhost:3001/cdn-cgi/local/scheduled?cron=15+*+*+*+*"`. Then, signed in, open
**Analytics** in the nav: the seeded **Organisation Overview** page renders with live member and
activity numbers. By hand, `curl -b <cookie> localhost:3001/api/analytics/pages` lists one page with
`templateKey: "tenant-overview"`, and an unauthenticated `curl -i localhost:3001/cubejs-api/v1/meta`
is a JSON 401, never HTML. `GET /api/analytics/facts/status` (owner/admin) shows the same freshness
as the CLI.

**With `--no-plugins` there is no analytics at all** — no nav item, no `/api/analytics`, no
`/cubejs-api`, no `/mcp`, and no drizzle-cube in either bundle. That is the kit's bare shape, and
`pnpm plugin add https://github.com/rocketflare-dev/rocketflare-plugin-analytics.git@1.0.2 --apply`
(then `pnpm db:generate --name plugin-analytics-1.0.2 && pnpm db:migrate`) is how it comes back.

> **Cookie note.** The session cookie is `__Host-session`, and the `__Host-` prefix *requires* the
> `Secure` flag even in development. Chrome and Firefox treat `http://localhost` as a secure context so
> this just works; Safari has historically been flaky about it. If Safari won't stay signed in locally,
> use the HTTPS tunnel (`pnpm dev:tunnel`, §1.10) or another browser.

### 1.7 CLI first run
The bootstrap already did this once: its `8/9 cli` step ran `pnpm cli whoami` with the seed's
one-time key (first run only — a re-run finds the key exists and skips; not with `--no-dev`, which
`/launch-setup` uses — run `pnpm cli login` yourself then). To use the CLI yourself, with `pnpm dev` still
running, in a second terminal:
```bash
pnpm cli login --server http://localhost:3001   # opens the browser; sign in, pick the tenant
pnpm cli whoami
```

> **Headless / no browser** (CI, agents): skip `pnpm cli login`. Sign in with the dev-login cookie
> (or any session) and hit `GET /auth/cli?redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:8765/callback` — the
> `Location` header carries `key=`; export it as `LAUNCH_API_KEY` with `LAUNCH_URL=http://localhost:3001`,
> then `pnpm cli whoami`. In real environments create a tenant API key in Settings → API keys instead.

`login` starts a loopback listener on the first free port in `127.0.0.1:8765–8770` and opens
`/auth/cli?redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback`; after login + tenant select the server
mints a tenant API key named `cli:<your hostname>` and redirects back. The key is stored in
`~/.launch/config.json` (mode `0600`) and is never printed in full.
Verify: `whoami` prints your email, the tenant name and a key prefix; `pnpm cli features list --json
| head` prints JSON; `ls -l ~/.launch/config.json` shows `-rw-------`; a wrong key exits `2`. For CI or
scripts, `LAUNCH_API_KEY` + `LAUNCH_URL` in the environment replace the config file (no browser).

### 1.8 Tests
```bash
pnpm test:db:up       # ephemeral Postgres on :5433 (max_connections=300; apps/web/docker-compose.test.yml, compose project launch-test)
pnpm test             # every package: web api + api-isolated + driver (real DB), ui (jsdom), config (no DB); cli
pnpm test:neon        # optional: the Neon proxy on :4433 + api, api-isolated and driver on the neon driver (CI's test-neon)
```
Verify: all projects green — including every installed plugin's own tests, which run in the host's
projects (`src/plugins/*/tests/{api,ui,config}`). The analytics plugin's `cube-isolation.test.ts`
is the one to watch: two tenants, every cube, disjoint rows.
`apps/web/tests/config/wrangler-parity.test.ts` passes with the
placeholder ids still in the tomls — the placeholder check only runs with `REQUIRE_PROVISIONED=1`
(Part 3). Single web projects: `pnpm web test:api`, `pnpm web test:ui`, `pnpm web test:config`.

### 1.9 The gate
```bash
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build
```
Verify: exits 0. This is the pre-commit gate for the whole workspace; `typecheck` regenerates
`apps/web/worker-configuration.d.ts` (commit it if it changed) and `build` produces
`apps/web/dist/{ui,api}` and `apps/cli/dist/cli.js`. The Worker bundle is large — drizzle-cube's
adapter carries its MCP transport, `docs/DEPLOY.md` "Bundle size" — and `pnpm install` prints one
`@duckdb/node-api` peer warning; neither is a problem.

### 1.10 Public URL via tunnel `[ready]` (optional)
For OAuth callbacks, emailed magic links or webhooks against your laptop:
```bash
pnpm web exec cfld setup   # once: picks a Cloudflare zone, stores apps/web/.cfld.json (git-ignored)
pnpm dev:tunnel            # cfld → :3000; apps/web/scripts/tunnel-dev.mjs passes the URL to wrangler as APP_URL
```
Verify: the printed `https://…` host opens the app; `/auth/methods` there reports the same providers
as localhost. `.dev.vars` and the tomls are untouched; plain `pnpm dev` still uses localhost. Add
the tunnel host to each OAuth app's redirect URIs (Part 2) to test those flows. The CLI can log in
through the tunnel too: `pnpm cli login --server https://<tunnel-host>`.

---

## Part 2 — External services `[config]`

None of these block local development. Each states what happens when it is absent. Secrets go in
`apps/web/.dev.vars` locally and `wrangler secret put` when deployed (Part 3); `[vars]` live in
`apps/web/wrangler.toml` and `apps/web/wrangler.staging.toml`.

### 2.1 Email — Resend
1. resend.com → verify your sending domain (SPF/DKIM)
2. Create an API key → `RESEND_API_KEY`
3. `EMAIL_FROM` in `[vars]` (both tomls) and `apps/web/.dev.vars`: a verified sender,
   `App <noreply@mail.example.com>`

Scripted (Part 3): with a full-access `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in `apps/web/.provision.env` (or exported), `pnpm provision email create --domain mail.example.com` creates the
Resend domain, writes its DNS records into the Cloudflare zone and sets `EMAIL_FROM` in both tomls;
`pnpm provision email verify <env>` polls verification and mints a per-environment sending key into
the Worker's `RESEND_API_KEY`; `email status` shows which records are present.

Absent: magic links, invitations and admin notifications are logged, never sent. Verify: request a
magic link — it arrives by email.

### 2.2 Google OAuth
1. Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen: External; scopes `openid`,
   `email`, `profile` only. While the screen is in *Testing* only listed test users can sign in —
   **Publish** it to let anyone reach the sign-up gate
2. Credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application. Authorized redirect URIs — Google matches
   exactly, add every origin you use:
   `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`, `https://<tunnel-host>/auth/google/callback`,
   `https://<staging-host>/auth/google/callback`, `https://<app-host>/auth/google/callback`
3. `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

Absent: the button is hidden (`GET /auth/methods`). Verify: "Continue with Google" round-trips.
An account whose `email_verified` is false is refused — for every provider.

### 2.3 Microsoft OAuth (Entra ID)
1. Azure Portal → App registrations → New; account type "any organizational directory and
   personal accounts" (the kit uses the `common` tenant)
2. Redirect URI (Web): `{APP_URL}/auth/microsoft/callback` for each origin as in 2.2
3. Certificates & secrets → new client secret → `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` / `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`

Absent: button hidden. Verify: round trip. Redirect URIs are always derived from `APP_URL`; there
is no `*_REDIRECT_URI` variable to set.

### 2.3b Sign in with any OIDC issuer (Keycloak, Okta, Entra single-tenant, Auth0…)
One generic OpenID Connect issuer per deployment, beside or instead of the buttons above
(`docs/CONCEPTS.md` §2).
1. At the issuer, create a **confidential web client** (or a public one — PKCE only, no secret) with
   the authorization-code flow. Redirect URI: `{APP_URL}/auth/oidc/callback` for each origin, as in
   2.2. Post-logout redirect URI (if the issuer asks): `{APP_URL}/login?signedOut=1`
2. Set `OIDC_ISSUER` to the issuer's `issuer` value **exactly** (open
   `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration` and copy it, trailing slash and all — a mismatch is
   refused), `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` unless the client is public. Optional:
   `OIDC_LABEL` (button text, default "Single sign-on"), `OIDC_SCOPES` (default
   `openid email profile`), `AUTH_OIDC_ONLY=true` (the login page goes straight to the issuer and
   hides every other method; the magic-link endpoint stays live for invitations — it hides, it does
   not disable), `OIDC_TRUST_EMAIL=true` (see Entra below). Locally these go in `.dev.vars`; deployed, everything but the secret is a
   `[vars]` entry in **both** tomls (commented templates are there) and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` is a
   Worker secret (3.5)
3. Issuer notes:
   - **Keycloak**: `OIDC_ISSUER=https://<host>/realms/<realm>`; "Client authentication" on for a
     confidential client. A `groups` mapper is optional — the claim is read, not stored
   - **Okta**: `OIDC_ISSUER=https://<org>.okta.com` (org server) or
     `https://<org>.okta.com/oauth2/default`; app type "Web", grant "Authorization Code"
   - **Entra ID, single tenant**: `OIDC_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0`;
     add the optional `email` claim to the ID token (Token configuration) — without it the kit
     falls back to the userinfo endpoint. Entra sends no `email_verified`, and the kit refuses a
     missing flag by default, so set **`OIDC_TRUST_EMAIL=true`** — only for a single tenant whose
     directory controls the `email` claim. (Multi-tenant Entra is the Microsoft button, 2.3)
   - **Auth0**: `OIDC_ISSUER=https://<tenant>.auth0.com/` — **with** the trailing slash, which is
     how Auth0 spells its issuer; Regular Web Application

Absent (`OIDC_ISSUER` blank): no `oidc` provider, the login page is unchanged. `AUTH_OIDC_ONLY=true`
without issuer and client id refuses to boot (config error). Verify: `/auth/methods` shows
`"oidc": { "label": … }`; "Continue with <label>" round-trips; `Sign out` returns to
`/login?signedOut=1` (through the issuer's logout page when it advertises `end_session_endpoint`).
An account whose `email_verified` is `false` — or missing, unless `OIDC_TRUST_EMAIL=true` — is
refused (`?error=email_unverified`); an existing kit user is linked by verified email.

### 2.4 First admin
`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS=you@example.com` (comma-separated). Promoted to global admin on the first
**verified** login, logged loudly. Absent: promote by hand once —
`UPDATE users SET is_global_admin = true WHERE email = '…'` — or every sign-up parks on `/pending`
with nobody to approve it (`SIGNUP_MODE=invite_only` default). Verify: `/admin` is reachable.

### 2.5 AI — chat, agents, embeddings
Resolution (`docs/CONCEPTS.md` §9): a per-agent assignment → the tenant's default provider in
Settings → AI → the platform `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → **Workers AI through the `AI` binding**. That last
tier means **chat and agents work on a fresh workspace with nothing configured**: Settings → AI shows
chat readiness `Cloudflare Workers AI · glm-4.7-flash · platform default`. Read the
cost line before relying on it, then pick any of these:

0. **Zero-key default — Workers AI.** Nothing to do; `wrangler dev` proxies the binding to your
   logged-in Cloudflare account and a deployed Worker uses its own. **Every call is billed to that
   account** (10 000 free neurons a day on any plan, then metered — GLM-4.7-Flash is about
   $0.06 / $0.40 per million input / output tokens); the `ai_usage` ledger counts the tokens. The
   floor is a model that can run the AGENTS, not just the chat box, so it needs real tool use: this
   one accepts `tool_choice`, carries tool calls in its event stream (so chat still streams token by
   token with tools on) and has a 131k context window, which is what stops one over-eager search
   poisoning the next turn. To make
   the kit zero-spend instead, comment the `[ai]` block out of BOTH tomls (the parity test keeps them
   in sync) — chat then answers 503 until a key or tenant provider exists. Any tenant can still add
   Workers AI explicitly as a chat provider (no key) to pick another model — cheaper and weaker,
   `@cf/mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct`, or anything else with function calling. Verify: `curl -b <cookie>
   localhost:3001/api/ai/config/readiness` → `"chat":{"ready":true,"source":"platform","provider":"workers_ai"…}`
   and `/chat` streams a reply.
1. **Platform key (optional).** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` in `apps/web/.dev.vars` (deployed:
   `wrangler secret put`, Part 3). Every tenant without its own chat provider then uses it with
   `claude-sonnet-4-5` — it ranks above Workers AI. Verify: Settings → AI (as owner/admin) shows chat
   readiness `Anthropic · claude-sonnet-4-5 · platform default`; `curl -b <cookie>
   localhost:3001/api/ai/config/readiness` → `"chat":{…,"source":"platform","provider":"anthropic"…}`.
2. **Tenant provider (no platform key).** Settings → AI → *Add provider*: scope `chat`, a label (it is
   the upsert key — renaming later means delete + re-add), provider `anthropic` / `anthropic_compatible`
   (Fireworks, Moonshot presets; base URL required) / `openai` / `openai_compatible`, model, API key
   (encrypted with `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, never shown again — the row reports `hasCredential`). The
   first row in a scope becomes the default. Press **Test connection** before saving (a 10-token
   completion; 10 per minute per IP). Verify: the test reports `ok` and a latency; readiness reads
   `tenant`.
3. **Local mock — develop with no key at all.** Run any OpenAI-compatible server (Ollama, vLLM, a
   proxy) and add an `openai_compatible` chat config with its base URL **including `/v1`**
   (e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1`), the model name it serves, and **any non-empty placeholder as
   the API key** (the adapter refuses an empty key; a local server ignores the bearer). Chat, the
   `summarize-text` agent and the usage table all work against it. Verify: `/chat` streams a reply.

Absent everywhere (no `[ai]` binding, no key, no tenant provider): `/chat` shows "configure AI";
`POST /api/chat/conversations` and the agent's `execute` step answer 503 `ai_not_configured` (the
agent enqueue itself still returns 202 and the run settles `failed`). Thinking is OFF unless a config
enables it with a budget (cost decision).

**Embeddings** (documents / hybrid search, `index: true` on the example agent): the `AI` Workers AI
binding (both tomls, and `wrangler dev` emulates it) is the zero-key default — `@cf/baai/bge-m3`,
1024-dim. Alternatives: an `embeddings`-scope tenant config (`openai`, `openai_compatible`,
`workers_ai`) or `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` for platform OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (reduced to 1024
dims). Verify: `POST /api/ai/documents/ingest` `{ "title": "t", "text": "hello world" }` → `status:
"indexed"`; `pnpm web db:check` reports the pgvector extension installed. Changing the dimension is a
new table (`docs/ADAPTING.md` §3).

**Document uploads** (Knowledge → Upload file): Markdown/text/CSV/JSON index straight away; PDF,
Word, Excel, OpenDocument, HTML and XML are converted by Workers AI Markdown Conversion on the same
`AI` binding (`wrangler dev` proxies it to Cloudflare, so `wrangler login` is needed; conversion of
documents is free) in the `document.convert` queue job. Verify: upload a small PDF on `/documents`,
watch the row go `Indexing → Indexed` within the 5 s poll (the wrangler terminal logs
`document.convert: indexed`), search a phrase from it, and click the download icon to get the
original back from R2. Without `[ai]` a binary upload answers 503 `conversion_not_configured`.

Agent runs need the `AGENT_RUN_WORKFLOW` binding (declared in both tomls; `wrangler dev` runs
instances locally). Without it `POST /api/agents/runs` is 503 `agent_runs_not_configured`. Verify
(from the Agents page in the nav, or by hand):
`POST /api/agents/runs` `{ "agentKey": "summarize-text", "input": { "text": "<a paragraph>" } }` →
202; `GET /api/agents/runs/<id>` reaches `succeeded` with `output.summary`.

**Human-in-the-loop walkthrough** (`docs/CONCEPTS.md` §9). A run can stop and ask a person, and
**`wrangler dev` is the only way to exercise that** — the suspend is `step.waitForEvent`, which the
Node test suite drives with a fake. Nothing extra to configure; `AGENT_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT`
(`168 hours`) is already in both tomls. With `pnpm dev` running and signed in at
`/login?as=owner@example.test`:

1. **Agents → Summarise text**, paste a paragraph, turn *index the result* ON, run it. Watch the
   timeline fill **live** (token-by-token it is not — the stream carries durable rows — but it
   arrives in well under a second, not in 3-second lumps), then stop on *"Add this summary to the
   knowledge base?"*. The Agents nav item shows a badge of 1, and the notification bell deep-links
   to the run.
   Verify: `GET /api/agents/runs/<id>` reports `status: "awaiting_input"` with one pending interrupt.
2. **Answer it from a second browser** signed in as `admin@example.test`, then answer the same one
   in the first. One gets a 200, the other a 409 `interrupt_not_pending` rendered as *"somebody else
   answered"* — not an error toast. The run resumes on its own.
   Verify: the run reaches `succeeded` and the document appears in `/documents` **exactly once**
   (the write is behind `ctx.once`; a second copy means that broke).
3. **Restart `pnpm dev` while a run is parked**, then answer it. The run resumes across the
   restart — `wrangler dev` loses the instance, so this also exercises the `sendEvent → not_found`
   path that creates `<runId>-r1`. This is the durability claim; if anything is going to be wrong,
   it is this.
4. **Cancel a parked run.** It settles `cancelled` with `error` NULL and its interrupts `expired` —
   a refusal is a status, not a fault.
5. **Ask `research-topic` something ambiguous.** It calls `ask_human` and raises a `choice` from
   inside a tool handler; answer it, then type a **steering note** into the still-running run and
   watch it appear in the timeline and change the answer. Ask it to *save* what it finds and it
   calls `index_finding`, which is gated by `Tool.requiresApproval` — approve it (editing the text
   first, which `allowEdits` permits) and the note lands in the knowledge base.
6. **Reload a settled run**: identical to the streamed version.
   `curl -N -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' "http://localhost:3001/api/agents/runs/<id>/agui/stream"`
   shows `data:`-only frames with `id:` on group boundaries only.

### 2.6 Tracing (D32)
Nothing to set up: every chat turn, agent run, tool call, retrieval and embeddings batch is
recorded as spans in the local `ai_spans` table, with zero credentials. Verify: send a chat message
or run the example agent, then (as an owner/admin, logged in with `pnpm cli login`):
```bash
pnpm cli traces list                  # newest first; --agent chat · --status error · --run <id>
pnpm cli traces show <traceId|runId>  # the span tree: model, tokens, latency, tool args/results
```
A chat turn shows `invoke_agent chat` with `chat <model>` and `execute_tool <name>` children, and
retrieval/embeddings under the tool. `OBSERVABILITY_CAPTURE_CONTENT=false` drops prompts and tool
I/O. Optional backend (Langfuse keys keep working with no new setting; Phoenix locally is
`docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix` + `OBSERVABILITY_PRESET=phoenix` +
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:6006` in `.dev.vars`): `docs/DEPLOY.md` § Tracing.

### 2.6b Evals (D33)
Optional, and it costs tokens: put `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `apps/web/.dev.vars`, then
```bash
pnpm test:db:up     # evals run against the TEST database and migrate it themselves
pnpm eval           # three starter suites: knowledge chat, summarize-text, research-topic
pnpm eval:view      # the score diff against the previous run, then the report UI
```
Without a key every suite skips and says why. Thumbs on chat replies and run output are live with
no setup; `pnpm cli feedback list --rating down` then `pnpm cli evals promote <id> --dataset <name>`
turns a bad answer into a case. Everything else — suites, judges, baselines, CI — is in
`docs/EVALS.md`.

### 2.7 Plugins `[ready]` (D31)

Analytics is not core; it is the `analytics` PLUGIN (from `rocketflare-dev/rocketflare-plugins`,
`plugins/analytics`, 3.4.1), committed with Launch, so a fresh clone has dashboards without you
doing anything. Nothing to configure.

```bash
pnpm plugin list                                   # what is installed, and from where
pnpm plugin check                                  # anchors, kit range, barrel lines, migrations
pnpm plugin remove analytics --apply               # then pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:migrate
pnpm plugin add <repo|path>[@ref]                  # read the plan; --apply installs it
```

**Every command prints its plan and stops until `--apply`.** Installing a plugin gives it full
Worker and database access — it is as trusting as merging a pull request — and the plan is what you
say yes to. It will never generate a migration, edit a wrangler toml or write a resource id: those
arrive as numbered steps you run yourself. The analytics plugin's are the `15 * * * *` cron and the
`/cubejs-api` + `/mcp` prefixes in both tomls, and two `resolve` entries plus two proxy lines in
`apps/web/vite.config.ts`.

**The drizzle-cube CLI / Claude Code plugin** (optional, with analytics installed): create
`apps/web/.drizzle-cube.json` — git-ignored, and the plugin repository's README has the shape —
with `apiToken` set to a tenant API key from Settings → API keys and `serverUrl` your `wrangler dev`
origin or a deployed host. It is an ordinary Bearer key: every query it makes is scoped to that
tenant by the cubes and it is revoked in the same place. Verify: the CLI's `meta` lists
`ActivityEvents`, `TenantActivityDaily`, `TenantUsers`, `Users`.

Writing one of your own: `/launch-plugin`, or `apps/web/src/plugins/CLAUDE.md` and the installed
`apps/web/src/plugins/analytics/`.

### 2.8 Feature flags `[ready]` (D30)

Nothing to configure — flags work out of the box, and Launch ships none yet (a flag is declared in
`CORE_FEATURE_FLAGS` or by a plugin's `SharedPlugin.features`). Once one exists, as a global admin
open **Admin → Feature flags**: set it to On, or to Rollout and the percentage decides
deterministically; force it on or off for one organisation and that beats the percentage either
way.

Two things worth knowing before you add your own:

- **`FEATURES_ENABLED` is the release gate, and `wrangler dev` reads `[vars]` from
  `wrangler.toml`** — the PRODUCTION value. So a flag you mark `environmentGated` and ship dark in
  production is dark on your laptop too unless `.dev.vars` lists it. That is why
  `.dev.vars.example` carries the key.
- **A flag is not a permission.** Gate with `requireFeature` / `{ feature: 'x' }`, never with
  `access Feature:x` — a global admin's `manage all` satisfies the CASL form and would show them a
  surface the deployment does not ship. `docs/CONCEPTS.md` §15 has the incident this rule came from.

Verify: `pnpm cli features list --json` prints the effective flags for your tenant; flipping one in
`/admin` changes it on the next call.

### 2.9 Rebrand checklist
Done when Launch was seeded from Rocketflare 0.15.0: package names (`@launch/*`), worker names, DB
names, CLI bin (`launch`) / config dir (`~/.launch`) / env prefix (`LAUNCH_`), `EMAIL_FROM`. The
themes and logo are still the kit's.

---

## Part 3 — Cloudflare deploy `[config]`

Two environments, two standalone tomls (`apps/web/wrangler.staging.toml`, `apps/web/wrangler.toml`),
one Neon project with a branch per environment, one GitHub Actions release flow. Only `apps/web` is
deployed; the CLI is built by CI but not published (publishing it is an app decision —
[`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md)). Reference: [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md).

**Before anything — three accounts you create yourself:**

1. **Cloudflare** on **Workers Paid** (Workflows, `[limits]`, and Hyperdrive if you deploy on
   `postgres`), **with your domain on the
   account** — registered there (https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/domains/register) or added
   as a site with its nameservers moved (https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/add-site). The
   app hosts (`routes`) and the Resend DNS records are created in that zone; `pnpm provision
   preflight` refuses a host or sending domain whose zone is not on the account. No domain yet →
   `--staging-host workers.dev --production-host workers.dev --skip-email`.
2. **Neon** — the free tier is fine for the two branches. (Deploying on another Postgres instead
   means `DATABASE_DRIVER = "postgres"` and Hyperdrive — `docs/DEPLOY.md` § Database driver; the
   provisioning below assumes Neon.)
3. **Resend** — the free tier is fine; it verifies the domain from (1). `--skip-email` skips it
   (magic links are logged in `wrangler tail`).

**Recommended: `/launch-provision`** in Claude Code, or `pnpm provision all` by hand
(`apps/web/scripts/provision.ts`; `pnpm provision --help` lists every phase and flag). It is REST
over `fetch` plus `wrangler` and `gh` — no vendor CLIs — idempotent (find-or-create), and every
phase ends in one `Verify:` line. The four tokens go in `apps/web/.provision.env` (git-ignored,
mode 0600): run **`pnpm provision tokens`** in your own terminal — it shows where to mint each one,
prompts with hidden input, verifies each against its vendor and writes the file — or copy
`apps/web/.provision.env.example` and fill it in. An exported variable of the same name overrides
the file (that is how CI runs it); never paste a token into a chat, and never put these in
`.dev.vars` (`wrangler dev` would load them into the Worker, and its `RESEND_API_KEY` is the app's
sending key, not this full-access one).

**The deployed driver** comes from the tomls' `DATABASE_DRIVER` — `neon` in a fresh copy: no
Hyperdrive, and the Worker holds the pooled Neon URI as its `DATABASE_URL` secret. Pass
`--driver postgres` to `pnpm provision cloudflare <env>` (or `all`) for Hyperdrive instead — any
Postgres, a read cache, one Hyperdrive config per environment. Either writes BOTH tomls.
`docs/DEPLOY.md` § Database driver has the table and the switch:

| Variable | Mint at | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens | Account: Workers Scripts, Workers KV Storage, Queues, Workflows, Durable Objects, R2 (+ Hyperdrive under `postgres`) — Edit; Workers AI, Account Analytics — Read. Zone: DNS — Edit on the zone holding your hosts and the sending domain |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Workers & Pages → Overview (right-hand column / the URL) | the 32-hex account id |
| `NEON_API_KEY` | https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys | personal or organisation key; creates the project and branches |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | https://resend.com/api-keys | Full access (creates the domain, mints a `sending_access` key per environment); or `--skip-email` |

Then `gh auth login` and `pnpm web exec wrangler login` in your own terminal (browser steps), and:

```bash
pnpm provision tokens [--skip-email]   # once, in your terminal: hidden prompts → apps/web/.provision.env (0600)
pnpm provision preflight --domain mail.example.com --staging-host workers.dev --production-host app.example.com --admin-email you@example.com
pnpm provision all [--deploy staging|both] [--skip-email] [--rotate]   # 10–20 minutes; stops at the first failed Verify
```

| Phase | Creates / does | Verify line |
|---|---|---|
| `tokens` | (a terminal, not an agent) prompts for the four tokens with hidden input, verifies each, writes `apps/web/.provision.env` (0600) | `tokens ok — set: CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, … → apps/web/.provision.env (0600)` |
| `preflight` | checks tools, tokens (environment, then the file) and accounts; resolves every custom host and the sending domain to a zone on the Cloudflare account (DNS readable by the token) — a missing zone fails with the registrar / add-site links; caches the four answers and the zone ids in `apps/web/.provision.json` (git-ignored, non-secret) | `preflight ok — app=… account=… neon=… resend=… zone=<zone> (<id>)` |
| `email create` | Resend domain, its DNS records in the Cloudflare zone, `EMAIL_FROM` in both tomls | `email create ok — domain=… zone=… records=… EMAIL_FROM="…"` |
| `neon` | Neon project (pg 17) + `staging` branch from the default branch, direct hosts, a password per branch | `neon ok — production=<host> staging=<host> (SELECT 1 on both)` |
| `cloudflare <env> [--driver d]` | `cf-provision.sh <env> --apply`: KV, Queue, R2 (+ Hyperdrive under `postgres`); ids patched into the toml; `--driver` rewrites `DATABASE_DRIVER` and the `[[hyperdrive]]` block in both tomls | `cloudflare <env> ok — <toml> patched; REQUIRE_PROVISIONED=1 parity test passed for both tomls` (once both are done) |
| `migrate <env>` | `pnpm db:migrate:ci` against that branch; applied count == journal entries | `migrate <env> ok — n/n migrations applied on <host>` |
| `github <env>` | GitHub Environment + `DATABASE_URL`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets (stdin) | `github <env> ok — environment <env> on <repo> has …` |
| `urls` | `APP_URL` + `routes` (custom host) or the `workers.dev` host in both tomls; parity test | `urls ok — staging=… production=…; parity test passed` |
| `deploy <env>` | `pnpm deploy[:staging]` (under `neon` it puts the Worker's `DATABASE_URL` right after the first deploy), then `/api/health` and `/api/ready` | `deploy <env> ok — <url>/api/health ok (version …), /api/ready ok, deployments listed` |
| `secrets <env>` | `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (generated) + every optional secret exported or in `apps/web/.provision.env`, over stdin; under `neon` also `DATABASE_URL` (the pooled Neon URI; `--rotate` re-puts it) | `secrets <env> ok — wrangler secret list shows n secret(s): …` |
| `email verify <env>` | Resend verification (polls ≤ 10 min), a per-environment sending key into `RESEND_API_KEY` | `email verify <env> ok — domain=… verified, RESEND_API_KEY set, …/auth/methods reports magic link` |
| `all` | every phase in order (`--deploy staging` by default), then a close-out checklist | `all ok — n phases passed; deployed …` |

Close-out: sign in with the admin's magic link — with `SIGNUP_MODE=invite_only` the first login lands
on `/pending`; as the global admin create the first organisation at `/admin` — add OAuth redirect
URIs, commit the two tomls (ids and URLs are not secrets), push, `pnpm cli login --server <APP_URL>`.
Known limits: `.claude/skills/launch-provision/reference.md`. The manual sequence below is the reference for
what each phase does.

### 3.1 Accounts and access
1. Cloudflare account on **Workers Paid** (Workflows and `[limits]` need it, and Hyperdrive under
   `postgres` — Hyperdrive's plan availability has changed over time; the Hyperdrive create step
   reports if the plan refuses it) **with your domain as a zone on it** (registered there, or its nameservers moved — the two
   links at the top of Part 3): the custom-domain `routes` and the email DNS records live in that
   zone. Without one, both hosts are `workers.dev` and email is `--skip-email`. `pnpm web exec
   wrangler login`.
   Verify: `pnpm web exec wrangler whoami` prints the account, and the dashboard lists the domain
   as an active zone.
2. CI API token (account scope): Workers Scripts, KV, Queues, Workflows, Durable Objects, R2
   (+ Hyperdrive under `postgres`) — edit; Workers AI, Account Analytics — read; Zone → DNS — edit on your zone.
   Verify: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=… pnpm web exec wrangler whoami` succeeds.
3. Neon: one project; branches `production` (main) and `staging` — create `staging` **before** the
   first migration, so each branch is migrated with its own password rather than inheriting a
   migrated main (the database's default owner role is kept on both). Record the **direct** and `-pooler` connection strings for each. Under `neon` the
   Worker gets the pooled one (3.5); under `postgres` Hyperdrive gets the direct host; `apps/web/scripts/migrate.ts` strips `-pooler` itself. Never put these strings in
   a file in this repo. Verify: `psql "<direct url>" -c 'select 1'` on both branches.

### 3.2 Provision Cloudflare resources
```bash
pnpm web provision:cloudflare staging --apply        # DATABASE_DRIVER = "neon" (the kit's tomls)
pnpm web provision:cloudflare production --apply
# tomls already on postgres (Hyperdrive needs the direct host):
NEON_DATABASE_URL='<staging direct url>' pnpm web provision:cloudflare staging --apply
```
`pnpm web provision:cloudflare` runs `apps/web/scripts/cf-provision.sh` with `apps/web` as its
working directory (the script also `cd`s there itself, so `bash apps/web/scripts/cf-provision.sh
staging --apply` from the root works too). It creates (or finds, by name) the resources: the KV
namespace `<APP>_RATE_LIMIT[_STAGING]`, the Queue `<app>-jobs[-staging]`, the R2 bucket
`<app>-files[-staging]` (the last two are name-referenced — nothing to paste) and, under
`postgres` only, the Hyperdrive config `<app>-<env>`. Switching the driver (the var and the
`[[hyperdrive]]` block, in both tomls) is `pnpm provision cloudflare <env> --driver neon|postgres`.
`--apply` writes the KV (and Hyperdrive) ids into the toml through
`scripts/provision/patch-toml.ts` (byte-preserving; a DIFFERENT existing id is refused unless
`--force`); without it the script prints the ids and a `sed` line to run yourself. The Workflow
(`[[workflows]]` `AGENT_RUN_WORKFLOW`), the Workers AI binding (`[ai]`) and the DO need no create
step — `wrangler deploy` registers them — but the Workflow `name` is account-scoped: staging MUST be
`<app>-agent-run-staging` (`docs/DEPLOY.md`, "Account-scoped names").
Verify: `REQUIRE_PROVISIONED=1 pnpm web test:config` passes — no `<PLACEHOLDER>` left, every
account-scoped staging name ends in `-staging`, ids differ. Commit the tomls (ids are not secrets).

### 3.3 GitHub Environments and secrets
Repository → Settings → Environments → create `staging` and `production`. In **each**:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | that branch's Neon connection string (owner role; pooled or direct) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | the token from 3.1 (may be shared) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | account id |

Verify: both environments list three secrets. Optionally add required reviewers to `production` if
your plan supports it; otherwise publishing the Release is the gate (3.6).

### 3.4 First deploy (the worker must exist before secrets can be set)
Actions → **Deploy** → Run workflow → environment `staging` (uses the ref you dispatch from). It
runs CI, the provisioned parity test, migrations against the staging branch, builds the UI and
deploys `wrangler.staging.toml` from inside `apps/web`. Runtime 500s are expected until 3.5.
Verify: the run is green; `pnpm web exec wrangler deployments list -c wrangler.staging.toml` shows it.

### 3.5 Worker secrets
**Under `neon`, first** put the Worker's database connection — the branch's **pooled** URI:
`printf '%s' "$POOLED_URL" | pnpm web exec wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL -c wrangler.staging.toml`
(`pnpm provision secrets <env>` does it from the Neon API). Then, for every other non-`[vars]` name
in `apps/web/.dev.vars.example` (skip `DATABASE_DRIVER` and `NEON_LOCAL_PROXY` — local only —
`DATABASE_URL` under `postgres`, which uses Hyperdrive, and `APP_DATABASE_URL` unless enabling RLS; the `OIDC_*` names other than
`OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTH_OIDC_ONLY`, are `[vars]` — Part 2.3b):
```bash
# one per name: OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY RESEND_API_KEY BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
#   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET ANTHROPIC_API_KEY EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY
#   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
printf '%s' "$OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY" | pnpm web exec wrangler secret put OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY -c wrangler.staging.toml
```
`wrangler secret put NAME` reads the value from stdin when stdin is not a terminal — pipe it with
`printf '%s' "$V"`, never `--body` or an argument, so the value stays out of argv and shell history
(interactively it prompts). `pnpm provision secrets <env>` does exactly this for every name exported
in the shell. Repeat without `-c` for production after its first deploy. Use different keys per
environment. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY`, the two `LANGFUSE_*` keys and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` are optional
(Part 2.5/2.6): skip them and the features degrade as described there.
Verify: `pnpm web exec wrangler secret list -c wrangler.staging.toml` shows the names;
`curl https://<staging-host>/api/health` returns ok, `curl https://<staging-host>/api/ready` returns
ok (it runs a query — a 503 there means the Worker cannot reach Neon: under `neon` a missing or
wrong `DATABASE_URL` secret, under `postgres` Hyperdrive pointing at the wrong host or SSL), and `/auth/methods` lists your providers. With `SIGNUP_MODE=invite_only` (the default) the
admin's first login lands on `/pending`; the first organisation is created at `/admin`.
Point the CLI at it: `pnpm cli login --server https://<staging-host>`.

### 3.6 Custom domains
Uncomment `routes = [{ pattern = "<host>", custom_domain = true }]` in each toml (staging host in
the staging file). Wrangler creates the DNS record on the next deploy. Set `[vars] APP_URL` to
`https://<host>` in the same file. Update OAuth redirect URIs (Part 2).
Verify: the host serves the app over HTTPS; the parity test still passes (`routes` may differ).

### 3.7 The release dance (every subsequent deploy)
1. Bump the **root** `package.json` version to X.Y.Z and move the `## Unreleased` lines in
   `CHANGELOG.md` under `## X.Y.Z`. Commit. (The `apps/*` versions are informational; one tag ships
   web and cli together.)
2. `git tag X.Y.Z && git push origin X.Y.Z` → **staging** deploys (`deploy.yml`: CI gate → parity
   with `REQUIRE_PROVISIONED=1` → `pnpm db:migrate:ci` on the staging branch →
   `pnpm --filter @launch/web build:ui` → `pnpm --filter @launch/web exec wrangler deploy -c
   wrangler.staging.toml --var RELEASE_VERSION:X.Y.Z`). The job fails if tag ≠ root version.
3. Check staging: `/api/health`, the version in the nav footer, the flow you changed.
4. `gh release create X.Y.Z --title X.Y.Z --generate-notes` → **production** deploys the release's
   tag with `wrangler.toml`. Publishing the Release is the promotion gate.
Verify: production `/auth/session` reports `releaseVersion: "X.Y.Z"`; `pnpm cli status` against it
prints the same version.

### 3.8 Rollback
- Fast: `pnpm web exec wrangler rollback [-c wrangler.staging.toml]` — redeploys the previous Worker
  version (code + bindings; **not** the database).
- Deliberate: re-run Actions → Deploy → `production` from the previous tag, or publish a Release on
  the previous tag again. Migrations are forward-only; write a compensating migration if a schema
  change must be undone.
Verify: `/auth/session` shows the expected version; `pnpm web exec wrangler tail` shows healthy requests.

### 3.9 What the parity test demands, in one place
`apps/web/tests/config/wrangler-parity.test.ts` runs in `pnpm test` (placeholders allowed) and in
`deploy.yml` with `REQUIRE_PROVISIONED=1` (placeholders forbidden). It reads both tomls relative to
`apps/web` (not the process cwd), so it behaves the same from the root and from the package. It
requires: identical binding names and DO `class_name`s, `compatibility_date`/`flags`, `[limits]`,
`[triggers].crons`, `[assets]`, `[[migrations]]` and `[vars]` keys across both files; staging `name`
= production `name` + `-staging`; every Workflow `name`, queue `queue`, R2 `bucket_name` in staging
ends in `-staging` and differs from production; Hyperdrive/KV ids differ; a `[[hyperdrive]]` block
is in both files or neither, and never in a `neon` file. When you add a binding, add
it to both files, run `pnpm types`, and commit `apps/web/worker-configuration.d.ts`.
