/**
 * A Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook: before a `git commit`, notice when a behaviour change is about
 * to be committed without an entry in `docs/upgrades/unreleased.md`.
 *
 * Why bother, given `.github/workflows/ci.yml` checks the same thing: the entry is much easier to
 * write while the change is in your head than a day later from a diff, and the note is the ONLY
 * thing that carries a kit improvement into the copies people are running.
 *
 * Two honest limits. It only fires inside a Claude Code session — a commit typed in a terminal
 * never sees it — and it is advisory: it prints and exits 0. The gate is CI; the hard stop is the
 * tag (`scripts/release-check.mjs`). Change the final `exit 0` to `exit 2` to make it blocking.
 *
 * It exits silently in an app rather than the kit: `.rocketflare.json` with an `app` block means
 * somebody's product, and the kit's release discipline is none of its business. It DOES fire in a
 * plugin repository (D31) — a checkout with a `rocketflare-plugin.json` at its root — because a
 * plugin has the same problem for the same reason: a host absorbs a plugin release by reading its
 * notes, so a release with none is a gap every host has to step over.
 *
 * Reads the hook payload as JSON on stdin. Never fails a commit on its own error.
