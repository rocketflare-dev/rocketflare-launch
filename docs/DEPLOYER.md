# External deployer protocol, v1

`deploy.yml` can deploy the Worker in two ways. By default the job holds a Cloudflare API token and
the environment's owner `DATABASE_URL`, migrates and runs `wrangler deploy` (`docs/DEPLOY.md` → CI/CD
flow). When the repository variable **`DEPLOYER_URL`** is set, it hands the build to an **external
deployer** instead, and CI holds **no Cloudflare token and no database credential**.

Why this exists: a Cloudflare token that can deploy a Worker can also bind **any** resource in the
account into it (another app's KV, R2, queue, database). A deployer that owns the token can check
every binding against what this app is allowed before anything goes live.

This page is the contract. The client side is `scripts/deployer.mjs` (no dependencies); any service
that implements the endpoints below can deploy a kit app.

## The flow

```
start ──► (approval) ──► build ──► upload ──► migrate ──► activate ──► finish (always)
  ticket    pending→        wrangler   deployer checks    pnpm db:migrate:ci   version    credentials
  opened    approved        --dry-run  the build, stores  with migratorUrl     goes live  revoked,
                            + build:ui an undeployed                                      ticket closed
                                       version, THEN
                                       issues migratorUrl
```

The order is the security property: **the build is checked before any credential exists**, so a
refused build cannot have migrated the database. A rejected or never-approved ticket gets no
build accepted, no credentials and no migration.

## Configuration (the GitHub side)

| Name | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DEPLOYER_URL` | repository variable | the deployer's base URL. Unset or empty → the default path |
| `DEPLOYER_AUDIENCE` | repository variable, optional | the OIDC audience to request. Default: the origin of `DEPLOYER_URL` |
| `WAIT_SECONDS` | step env, optional | how long `start` waits for approval (default 300) |
| `permissions: id-token: write` | both deploy jobs | lets the job mint OIDC tokens |

The GitHub Environments `staging` and `production` still exist (they scope the OIDC `environment`
claim); on this path they need no secrets.

## Authentication

Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, where the token is a **GitHub Actions OIDC
token** minted fresh for that call (`ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` + `&audience=<DEPLOYER_AUDIENCE>`).
The deployer verifies it against `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/.well-known/jwks` and
checks, at minimum:

| Claim | Check |
|---|---|
| `iss` | `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` |
| `aud` | the audience this deployer answers to |
| `repository` (better: `repository_id`, stable across renames) | a repository registered as this app |
| `environment` | `staging` or `production`, mapped to the app's environment — the ticket deploys only that one |
| `job_workflow_ref` | starts with `<owner>/<repo>/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@` — otherwise any workflow on any branch that can target the environment could ask |
| `ref` | `refs/heads/<default branch>` or `refs/tags/*` (a tag push and a published Release both carry the tag) |
| `run_id` (+ `run_attempt`) | recorded on the ticket at `start`; every later call on that ticket must come from the same run and environment, so one run cannot use another's approval |

Answer **401** for a missing, invalid or wrong-audience token and **403** for a valid token the
deployer does not accept. Approval policy (automatic for staging, a person for production, …) is
the deployer's business.

## Endpoints

All bodies are JSON. Every non-2xx response is `{ "error": "<human-readable reason>", … }`; the
client prints `error` and fails the step. The client ignores response fields it does not know.

### `POST /deploy/start`

Request: `{ "protocol": 1 }`. Response **200**: `{ "id": "<ticket id>", "status": "pending" | "approved" | "rejected" }`.
An unsupported `protocol` → **400** `{ "error": …, "supported": [1] }`. The client exports the id
as `DEPLOYER_TICKET` for the later steps.

### `GET /deploy/:id`

Response **200**: `{ "id", "status" }` (plus anything informative). The client polls every 10 s until
`approved` (continue), `rejected` (fail) or `WAIT_SECONDS` elapses (fail). A 5xx is retried; any
other non-2xx fails.

### `POST /deploy/:id/upload`

Allowed only on an `approved` ticket (otherwise **409**). Request:

```json
{
  "protocol": 1,
  "version": "1.4.0",
  "main": "worker.js",
  "toml": "<the wrangler config, verbatim>",
  "modules": { "worker.js": "<base64>", "chunks/lib.js": "<base64>", "abc123.wasm": "<base64>" },
  "assets": { "/index.html": "<base64>", "/assets/app-3f2a.js": "<base64>" }
}
```

- `toml` is the file named by `TOML` (`apps/web/wrangler.staging.toml` or `apps/web/wrangler.toml`).
  The deployer parses it itself and **refuses** (403, `{ "error", "refused": ["kv_namespaces X=…"] }`)
  any `name` that is not this app's Worker and any binding not registered for this app and
  environment. Never trust it beyond that.
- `modules` is every file `wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir` wrote, keyed by its path relative to
  the outdir, except source maps (`*.map`) and wrangler's `README.md`. Module type follows
  wrangler's default rules: `.js`/`.mjs` ES module, `.cjs` CommonJS, `.wasm` compiled Wasm, `.bin`
  data, `.txt`/`.html`/`.sql` text. `main` names the entry module.
- `assets` is every file under the toml's `[assets] directory` (the built UI), keyed by its
  `/`-rooted path, `.assetsignore` excluded. `{}` when the toml has no `[assets]`.
- `version` becomes the Worker's `RELEASE_VERSION` var; the deployer sets it, the toml's `[vars]`
  otherwise apply as written. Worker secrets are the deployer's to manage and must survive the
  deploy (Cloudflare: `keep_bindings: ["secret_text"]`).
- **Size.** Everything is base64 inside one JSON body, about 4/3 of the bytes on disk; the kit's own
  build is a few MB. A deployer should accept at least 50 MB. Cloudflare's own limits still apply
  (Worker size per plan, 25 MiB per asset file).

Response **200**: `{ "id", "status": "uploaded", "migratorUrl": "postgresql://…", … }` (e.g. a
`versionId`). The deployer stores the build as an **undeployed version** (Cloudflare: the Workers
Versions API) and only then issues `migratorUrl`. The client masks it (`::add-mask::` for the URL
and its password) and exports it as `MIGRATOR_URL`; it is never printed.

**`migratorUrl`** is a Postgres connection string for this environment's database that the next
step runs `pnpm db:migrate:ci` with (`db-roles --phase=role` → migrations → `db-roles
--phase=grants`), so the role must be able to:

- own the schema: create and alter every table (it is the tables' owner, or the role that created them);
- `CREATE ROLE launch_app` and `ALTER ROLE` it (`CREATEROLE`);
- `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE <its own username>` — `db-roles.ts` names the URL's user as the
  owner, so that user must be the one the tables are created by.

In practice: the database owner role, or an equivalent. Prefer the **direct** (non-pooled) host
(`migrate.ts` strips a Neon `-pooler` itself). It must be **short-lived**: valid from this response
until `activate` or `finish`, whichever comes first, then revoked (e.g. the password reset). The
deployer never stores it.

### `POST /deploy/:id/activate`

Allowed only on an `uploaded` ticket. The deployer makes the uploaded version live (Cloudflare: a
deployment at 100%) and revokes `migratorUrl`. Response **200**: `{ "id", "status": "active" }`.

### `POST /deploy/:id/finish`

Always called last (`if: always()`), after success, failure, rejection or a timeout. **Idempotent**:
it revokes `migratorUrl` if still live and closes the ticket, and answers **200** `{ "id", "status" }`
on any ticket this run owns, however many times it is called. A ticket finished before `activate`
never goes live. The client skips the call when `start` never opened a ticket.

## Ticket statuses

| Status | Meaning | Next |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | opened, waiting for approval | `approved`, `rejected`, `finished` |
| `approved` | may upload; no build accepted, no credentials issued | `uploaded`, `failed`, `finished` |
| `rejected` | refused by a person or a policy. Terminal | — |
| `uploaded` | build checked and stored as an undeployed version; `migratorUrl` issued | `active`, `failed`, `finished` |
| `active` | the version is live; credentials revoked | `finished` |
| `finished` | closed by `finish`; credentials revoked. Terminal | — |
| `failed` | the deployer could not complete a step (e.g. activation). Terminal; production keeps serving the previous version | — |

## Versioning

This is **protocol 1**. The client sends `"protocol": 1` in `start` and `upload`. Within v1 a
deployer may add response fields and optional request fields; the client ignores what it does not
know. Anything else — a renamed field, a new required step, a different auth scheme — is protocol 2,
and a deployer that supports both answers by the `protocol` the client sent. A deployer that does
not support the client's version answers `start` with **400** and `supported`.

## Testing

`apps/web/tests/config/deployer.test.ts` runs `scripts/deployer.mjs` against a fake deployer and a
fake OIDC endpoint: the whole flow, the payload, the masking, rejection, timeout and `finish` with
no ticket. It is the executable half of this page.
