/**
 * The shared half of a plugin (D31).
 *
 * A plugin is a separate git repository COPIED into an app — never installed from npm, exactly
 * like the kit itself — that contributes contracts, routes, schema, UI and CLI commands through
 * five barrels. `SharedPlugin` is the part all three consumers see: the zod contracts, the keys it
 * owns, and the `[vars]` it needs.
 *
 * **This module never imports one of the five composers AT RUNTIME, and nor does a plugin's own
 * `index.ts`.** The five — `ai/agents.ts`, `jobs.ts`, `permissions.ts`, `features.ts`,
 * `realtime.ts` — read the plugin barrel to open their closed sets, so a plugin module importing
 * one of them back closes a cycle through `plugins/index.ts` and leaves one of the two sides
 * holding `undefined` at module-evaluation time.
 *
 * A RUNTIME import is the only kind that can do that, so a whole-declaration `import type` is
 * fine — which is why `FeatureDefinition` is imported from `../features` below rather than
 * restated: one definition of what a feature flag is, and no copy to drift. `import { type X }
 * from` is NOT fine: eliding every specifier leaves an empty import clause, and whether that
 * survives as a bare side-effect import is the bundler's decision rather than ours.
 * `apps/web/tests/config/shared-imports.test.ts` checks all three spellings.
 *
 * `JobVariant` is spelled locally, and not because of that rule: zod's own
 * `ZodDiscriminatedUnionOption<'type'>` IS the constraint `jobInputSchema` puts on a variant, so
 * naming it here rejects a malformed one where the plugin author is looking.
 *
 * Everything a plugin keys is namespaced with its `id` (tables `<id>_*`, job types `<id>.x`,
 * subjects, prompt/agent/feature keys, query-key roots `<id>:…`, the API prefix `/api/<id>`), so
 * two plugins installed in one app cannot collide and the host can always say which one owns a row.
