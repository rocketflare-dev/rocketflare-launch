/**
 * Feature flags (D30) — the registry, the contracts, and the ONE implementation of "is this
 * feature on for this request".
 *
 * Two layers, in this order, because they answer two different questions:
 *
 *   1. ENVIRONMENT — does this surface exist in this deployment at all? A `[vars]` decision
 *      (`FEATURES_ENABLED`), fail-closed, no database. This is what lets half-built code be
 *      released to production dark, and it is settled before any row is read.
 *   2. ROLLOUT — among deployments where it exists, which tenants (or users) have it yet? A
 *      database decision a global admin drives from `/admin`: on, off, or a percentage.
 *
 * The composition is total and is written once, in `evaluateFlag`:
 *
 *   environmentGated && key not in FEATURES_ENABLED  -> false          (layer 1 wins outright)
 *   a tenant override row exists                     -> override.enabled
 *   state 'on' / 'off'                               -> true / false
 *   state 'rollout'                                  -> bucket(key, unitId) < rolloutPercent
 *   no row at all                                    -> the registry default
 *
 * The override beats the rollout because that is what it is FOR: the design-partner allow-list and
 * the "this customer must never get it" block-list. Its `enabled` column is the decision and the
 * row's presence is merely the exception — the same "a column, not the presence of rows" rule that
 * `visibility` follows in the schema helpers.
 *
 * **A flag is configuration, not a permission.** Nothing here touches CASL, and no gate may ask the
 * ability: `manage all` and `access all` are wildcards that cover every `Feature:` subject, so an
 * ability check hands platform staff a surface the deployment does not ship. See `permissions.ts`.

// ---- The bucket ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * FNV-1a 32-bit over `"<key>:<unitId>"`, reduced to 0..99.
 *
 * **This is a wire format.** Changing the hash, the separator or the modulus reshuffles every live
 * rollout — tenants already inside one would fall out of it. Treat it as frozen;
 * `tests/config/features.test.ts` pins golden vectors for exactly that reason.
 *
 * Three properties the rest of the design leans on:
 *
 *   - MONOTONIC. The bucket depends only on `(key, unitId)` — never on the percentage — and the
 *     test is `bucket < rolloutPercent`. So raising the percentage only ever ADDS units; nobody is
 *     ever dropped from a rollout that grows. This is the whole reason the percentage is not part
 *     of the hashed string, and why it must never be.
 *   - INDEPENDENT ACROSS FLAGS. `key` is in the string, so flag A's 10% cohort is uncorrelated with
 *     flag B's. Hashing the unit id alone would inflict every early rollout on the same unlucky few.
 *   - The modulo bias is real and negligible: 2^32 % 100 = 96, so buckets 0..95 are favoured by
 *     ~2.3e-8 relative. Not worth "fixing" — a different hash would silently reshuffle production.
