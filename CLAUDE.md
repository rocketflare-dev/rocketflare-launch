# Launch

Multi-tenant SaaS starter for internal tools and B2B products, a **pnpm workspace**: Hono API + React UI in one
Cloudflare Worker (`apps/web`), a CLI (`apps/cli`), private zod contracts
(`packages/shared`). `AGENTS.md` symlinks here.

> **How it works**: `docs/CONCEPTS.md` — one section per subsystem with its known gaps. **Check it
> before assuming a capability exists; update it when you change one.**
> **Setup**: asked for setup help → run `/rf-setup` (it drives `scripts/bootstrap.sh --no-dev`, then
> starts the server): show each `✔ n/10` line, stop on failure. By hand: `SETUP.md` Part 1.
> **Fresh copy?** `/rf-adapt <slug>`, then `docs/ADAPTING.md`. `/rf-setup`, `/rf-adapt`, `/rf-preflight`,
> `/rf-traces`, `/rf-evals` and `/rf-plugin` you
> may run yourself; **`/rf-provision` is user-invoked only** (it creates paid resources and prompts for
> tokens on a TTY) — asked to deploy, tell the user to run `/rf-provision`.
> **Plugins** (D31, `docs/CONCEPTS.md` §16): a plugin is a git repository copied in, wired through six
> barrels — `pnpm plugin add|upgrade|remove|list|check`, driven by `/rf-plugin`, which always shows the
> plan before `--apply`. It imports the host only through the DECLARED entries (`docs/plugin-api.md`,
> generated and diff-checked) and receives everything else as injected context. `.rocketflare.json`'s `defaultPlugins` is what a fresh clone installs
> (bootstrap step `6/10 plugins`).
> **Copies of the kit upgrade.** `.rocketflare.json` records the kit version, the app's names and the
> manifest of replaceable surfaces; `/rf-upgrade` ports later releases into a copy and never
> recreates a surface whose anchor file is gone. **A behaviour change here needs an entry in
> `docs/upgrades/unreleased.md` in the same commit** — CI fails without one, and the tag gate refuses
> a release with no note. `pnpm kit:release <version>` writes the release assets.

## Stack

- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (`nodejs_compat`); one Worker exports `fetch`+`queue`+`scheduled`
  + DO/Workflow classes (`src/worker.ts`). Node 24, pnpm 10
- **API**: Hono 4, zod contracts from `@launch/shared`, CASL. **DB**: Postgres 17 + pgvector —
  Docker locally; deployed, `DATABASE_DRIVER` (D35) picks Drizzle over the Neon serverless driver
  (`neon`, HTTP + a WS pool for transactions — the kit's tomls) or `postgres.js` via Hyperdrive
  (`postgres`, any Postgres — a missing var, and local/`.dev.vars`); `openDatabase(env)`, 1 client/request;
  raw results only through `rows()`/`affected()`
- **Auth**: arctic (Google, Microsoft, any OIDC issuer — jose-verified `id_token`, off by default) + magic link + dev-login; `__Host-session`; API keys; KV rate limit
- **Async / realtime**: Queues (`JOBS_QUEUE`), `NotificationsHub` DO `/ws`, R2 (`FILES`), cron, Workflows
- **AI**: `services/ai/resolve` (`agent_models` → tenant `ai_configs` → platform key → Workers AI via
  `[ai]`, zero key → 503); Anthropic / OpenAI-compatible / Workers AI chat streamed as **AG-UI**
  (`@ag-ui/core` pinned; SSE or protobuf; `POST /api/agui/run` is the protocol endpoint), chat calls
  the knowledge tools, agents on `AGENT_RUN_WORKFLOW` (projected to AG-UI on read), Workers AI →
  pgvector (uploads: R2 → `AI.toMarkdown` → pgvector), OTLP tracing (D32: GenAI
  spans → Langfuse/Phoenix/any backend, always also `ai_spans` → `launch traces`); evals (D33:
  `apps/evals`, vitest-evals on vitest 4, `pnpm eval`, never in the gate) + thumbs feedback →
  `launch evals promote`
- **Analytics**: not core — the `analytics` PLUGIN (D31, the one `defaultPlugins` entry, installed
  by the bootstrap): drizzle-cube at `/cubejs-api`+`/mcp`, fact tables on the `:15` cron, dashboards
- **UI**: React 18 + Vite, DaisyUI 5 / Tailwind v4, React Router 6, TanStack Query 5; served as `ASSETS`
- **CLI**: commander + chalk + open; `tsx` in dev, `tsc` → `dist/cli.js` (bin `launch`)
- **Tests**: vitest projects `api` · `api-isolated` · `driver` · `ui` · `config` (Postgres :5433; `postgres`
  in the gate, `pnpm test:neon` / CI `test-neon` through the local Neon proxy); cli; the
  eval kit's unit tests (`apps/evals/tests`). Evals themselves are `pnpm eval`, outside the gate
- **Lint**: Biome 2 at the root (single quotes, `asNeeded` semicolons, 100 cols)

## Commands (from the workspace root)

```bash
pnpm bootstrap · pnpm preflight  # first run in one go (--offline/--online toggle [ai]) / read-only check
pnpm dev:db:up && pnpm db:migrate  # Postgres on the first free port from :5432 → DATABASE_URL; role → migrations → grants
pnpm seed [--demo] && pnpm dev  # tenant/users/key (+ populated workspace); wrangler :3001 + vite :3000 (strict ports)
pnpm dev:stop · pnpm dev:status · pnpm dev:db:status  # kill this repo's dev tree / port holders / every dev database
pnpm cli login --server http://localhost:3001  # browser → ~/.launch/config.json, then whoami
pnpm test:db:up && pnpm test  # every package; web loads .env.test (postgres driver)
pnpm test:neon · pnpm dev:db:up --neon|--postgres  # D35: the suite / local dev on the neon driver via the proxy
pnpm eval [suite] [--model x] [--compare] · pnpm eval:baseline · pnpm eval:view  # real-model evals (D33, docs/EVALS.md)
pnpm lint · pnpm typecheck · pnpm build  # workspace-wide
pnpm web <script>  # any apps/web script (test:api, db:check…)
pnpm db:generate · pnpm db:studio · pnpm deploy[:staging] · pnpm provision all  # (or one phase: --help)
pnpm kit:upgrade [--to X.Y.Z] [--apply] · pnpm kit:release X.Y.Z  # port a kit release into a copy / cut one
```

`wrangler` lives in `apps/web`: `pnpm --filter @launch/web exec wrangler …`, never at the root. No
`RESEND_API_KEY` → magic-link URLs are logged; no AI key → chat/agents 503; zero creds locally.

```

**`packages/shared`.** Private, no build: `@launch/shared/<module>` → `./src/<module>.ts` (incl. `ai/*`,
`plugins/<id>`). Imports only `zod`, siblings, type-only `@casl/ability`, and `@ag-ui/core` (pinned,
zod-only, no platform APIs) in `src/ai/agui.ts` alone — the AG-UI wire format is validated by the
protocol's own schemas on both sides, which a mirror cannot give. A fifth dependency needs the same
written justification, and `apps/web/tests/config/shared-imports.test.ts` enforces the list.

**`apps/cli`.** `login` opens `GET /auth/cli?redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback`; the server
mints a tenant API key `cli:<host>` → `?key=&tenant_id=&tenant_name=`; stored `0600` in
`~/.launch/config.json` (`LAUNCH_API_KEY`/`LAUNCH_URL` for CI). Also `logout|whoami|status|config`,
`members|keys|activity list --json` (`.claude/rules/cli.md`)

## Config model

`[vars]` in both tomls, read via `loadConfig(env)`: `APP_ENV` (`development|staging|production`) ·
`TENANCY_MODE` (`multi|single` — same schema; single auto-joins the one tenant) ·
`SIGNUP_MODE` (`open|invite_only|approval`; `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS` seeds the first admin) ·
`TENANT_SCOPE_MODE` (`off|enforce`, `docs/RLS.md`) · `DATABASE_DRIVER` (`neon|postgres`, D35; missing =
`postgres`, `neon` needs the `DATABASE_URL` secret; `.dev.vars` overrides locally, with `NEON_LOCAL_PROXY`) · `AGENT_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` · `AGENT_MAX_TURNS` ·
`CHAT_KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS` (`true|false` — chat may call the knowledge tools) ·
`CHAT_HISTORY_MAX_CHARS` (history a turn replays; older turns are summarised by `chat.compact`) ·
`FEATURES_ENABLED` (D30 — comma-separated feature keys this deployment ships at all; fail-closed,
consulted only for a flag marked `environmentGated`; the rollout state itself lives in Postgres) ·
`OIDC_ISSUER`/`OIDC_CLIENT_ID`/`OIDC_LABEL`/`OIDC_SCOPES`/`AUTH_OIDC_ONLY`/`OIDC_TRUST_EMAIL`
(optional SSO through any OIDC issuer, declared only when used — `SETUP.md` 2.3b; secret
`OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`).

Rules (auto-loaded by path): `.claude/rules/api.md` · database.md · ui.md · cli.md · testing.md ·
code-quality.md · cloudflare.md. Runbooks: `docs/DEPLOY.md` · `docs/RLS.md`

## Non-Negotiables

- **Gate**: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build` pass before every commit
- **Tenant isolation**: every domain query filters by `tenantId` from the auth context; every tenant
  table calls `tenantIsolation()` (RLS inert; `rls-coverage.test.ts` enforces), a plugin's tables
  included — and a plugin adding a query surface of its own (the analytics plugin's cubes) owns the
  test that proves it scopes, because the kit cannot
- **Contracts first**: zod schema in `packages/shared/src/` → route `validate()` → UI/CLI parse the same
  schema; errors are `{ error, statusCode, code?, details? }`
- **shared is private** — never publish it; never import `apps/web` from `packages/shared` or `apps/cli`
- **Routes enqueue, never run**: long work → `JOBS_QUEUE` or `AGENT_RUN_WORKFLOW`; side effects in
  `waitUntil`; concurrency is a DB claim row, never a `Map`; SSE routes use `streamDatabase(c)`
- **Two tomls, one shape**: bindings, class names, `compatibility_*`, `[limits]`, crons identical in
  `apps/web/wrangler{,.staging}.toml`; account-scoped names differ (parity test)
- **Secrets** never in a toml, git or a response (`hasCredential`); `.dev.vars` comments hold no other
  credentials; the CLI never prints a full key; `gitleaks` in CI
- **No `process.env` / Node-only APIs in `apps/web/src/`** (`pg`, `ws`, `node:fs`…); `build:api` catches it
- **Release = root version**: git tag == root `package.json` `version` (ships web + cli)
- **Docs in sync**: a behaviour change updates CONCEPTS / SETUP / DEPLOY / rules in the same PR,
  **and adds an entry to `docs/upgrades/unreleased.md`** — copies of the kit absorb changes by
  reading those notes, so a change with no note never reaches them (CI and the tag gate enforce it)
- **A plugin composes, it never redefines** (D31): it namespaces everything with its id (tables
  prefixed from it — `example-feature` → `example_*`, and `plugin check` fails a collision — job
  types `<id>.x`, query-key roots `<id>:…`, `/api/<id>`, CUSTOM events `<id>.` — **never `kit.`**),
  reaches core only through the six barrels, its own four published entries and the DECLARED import
  entries (`@/plugins/api`, `@/db/schema/kit`, `@testkit/*` — `docs/plugin-api.md`), and ships
  no migration and no toml edit — the host generates the DDL; its bindings go in BOTH tomls
- **Released history is never rewritten**: an adopted copy pins a kit commit in `.rocketflare.json`;
  a force-push to a released tag orphans every copy that came from it
